"Our way is the old way"?

110
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:36,832
The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

111
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,254
Is it true he saw the white walkers?

112
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,259
The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.

113
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,927
So he was lying?

You will feed them yourselves.

141

00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,643
What about you?

143
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,186
I'm not a Stark.

As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you...

you worry too much.

151
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,694
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

152
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,909
When we were seven and you jumped off
the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

153
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:25,413
100-foot drop into the water...
you were never afraid.

154
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,165
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told Father.

My husband.

158
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,223
If he told the king, both our heads would be
skewered on the city gates by now.

159
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,894
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know,
it died with him.

160
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,605
And Robert will choose
a new Hand of the King,

someone to do his job while he's off
fucking boars and hunting whores.

162
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:57,112
Or is it the other way around?

163
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,990
And life will go on.

164
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,701
You should be the Hand of the King.

165
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,413
That's an honor I can do without.

166
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,163
Their days are too long,

167
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,958

All these years,

172
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,960
and I still feel like an outsider
when I come here.

173
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,463
You have five northern children.

174
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,009
You're not an outsider.

175
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,636
I wonder if the old gods agree.

176

- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

Jon Arryn is dead.

180
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:26,910
A fever took him.

181
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,957
I know he was like a father to you.

182
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,128
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

183
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,256
gods be good.

184
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,851
The raven brought more news.

185
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,355
The king rides for Winterfell...

186
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,192
with the queen and all the rest of them.

187
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,445
If he's coming this far north...

188
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,032
there's only one thing he's after.

189
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,537
You can always say no, Ned.

190
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:22,589
[Catelyn] We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

191
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,469
- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.

192
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,763
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

193
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,432
stature?

194
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,435
We've brought up eight barrels of ale
from the cellar.

195
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,769
Perhaps we'll find out.

196
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:37,730
In any case, candles.

197
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,780
Why is your mother so dead set on us
getting pretty for the king?

198
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:49,659
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

199
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,827
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

200
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:55,414
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab
with his right royal prick.

201
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,461
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

202
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,880
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

203
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,714
[Laughter]

204
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,544
- [Pup yaps]
- Gods, but they grow fast.

205
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,507
Brandon!

206
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,634
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

207
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,846
How many times have I told you?
No climbing.

208
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:54,932
But he's coming right now, down our road.

209
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,358
I want you to promise me,

210
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,152
no more climbing.

211
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,157
I promise.

212
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,372
- Do you know what?
- What?

213
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,707
You always look at your feet
before you lie.

214
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,750
[Chuckles]

215
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:23,627
Run and find your father.

216
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,797
Tell him the king is close.

217
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,595
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

218
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,065
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh.

219
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,108
What are you doing with that on?

220
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,614
- Go on.
- [Groans]

221
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,657
[Arya] Move!

222
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,385
[Neighs]

223
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,659
Your Grace.

224
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:05,832
You've got fat.

225
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,173
[Laughter]

226
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,470
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

227
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,060
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

228
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:30,731
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.

229
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,195
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

230
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,823
[Robert] Who have we here?

231
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,534
You must be Robb.

232
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,622
My, you're a pretty one.

233
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,916
Your name is?

234
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,419
Arya.

235
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:55,213
Oh, show us your muscles.

236
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,843
[Chuckles] You'll be a soldier.

237
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,140
[Arya] That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

238
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,392
[Sansa] Would you please shut up?

239
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:19,821
My queen.

240
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,949
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

241
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,910
We've been riding for a month, my love.

242
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,037
Surely the dead can wait.

243
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,038
Ned.

244
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,924
Where's the Imp?

245
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,430
[Queen] Where is our brother?

246
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,307
Go and find the little beast.

247
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:50,353
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

248
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,815
One minute he was fine and then...

249
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,777
burned right through him,
whatever it was.

250
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,946
I loved that man.

251
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,406
We both did.

252
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:06,868
[Robert] He never had to teach you much,
but me? You remember me at 16?

253
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:08,829
- [Chuckles]
- All I wanted to do

254
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,582
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

255
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,836
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

256
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,587
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

257
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,548
[Both laugh]

258
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,009
[Sighs]

259
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,178
I need you, Ned,

260
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,973
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

261
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,644
Lord Eddard Stark...

262
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,064
I would name you the Hand of the King.

263
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,653
I'm not worthy of the honor.

264
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,197
I'm not trying to honor you.

265
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,031
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

266
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,869
while I eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave.

267
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,829
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

268
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,333
You helped me win the Iron Throne,

269
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,170
now help me keep the damn thing.

270
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,672
We were meant to rule together.

271
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,634
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

272
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,179
Well, it's not too late.

273
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,515
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

274
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,019
We'll join our houses.

275
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:19,025
[Woman moaning]

276
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,038
[Sighs]

277
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,085
[Cup falls]

278
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,172
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

279
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,381
[Giggles]

280
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:51,723
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

281
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,476
I did hear something about that.

282
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,769
And the queen and her twin brother.

283
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,940
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

284
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,942
And the other brother?

285
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,278
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

286
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,198
and there's the clever one.

287
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,991
Mmm...

288
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:12,369
I hear they call him the Imp.

289
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,288
I hear he hates that nickname.

290
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:17,791
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

291
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,169
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

292
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,755
prone to all manner of perversions.

293
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,673
Clever girl.

294
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:28,260
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

295
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,180
Have you?

296
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,682
- Already?
- Oh!

297
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,311
- The gods gave me one blessing.
- [Laughs]

298
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,480
[Door opens]

299
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,694
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

300
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,490
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

301
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:51,659
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

302
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,953
but our sister craves your attention.

303
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,664
She has odd cravings, our sister.

304
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,834
A family trait.

305
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,420
Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

306
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:07,383
- Don't leave me alone with these people.
- I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

307
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,845
And this is the first of many courses.

308
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,180
I thought you might say that.

309
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,932
But since we're short on time...

310
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:17,351
Come on, girls.

311
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,104
[Giggling]

312
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:25,108
See you at sundown.

313
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,319
[Tyrion] Close the door!

314
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,500
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

315
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:46,588
She should be on a hill somewhere

316
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,049
with the sun and the clouds above her.

317
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,218
She was my sister.

318
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,011
This is where she belongs.

319
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,515
She belonged with me.

320
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,191
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

321
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:11,029
It's done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.

322
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,160
Not all of them.

323
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,579
[Gull crying]

324
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,048
[Man] Daenerys!

325
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,927
Daenerys.

326
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,055
There's our bride-to-be.

327
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,642
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

328
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,811
Touch it.

329
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,146
Go on, feel the fabric.

330
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,069
Mmm.

331
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,074
Isn't he a gracious host?

332
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:02,123
We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.

333
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,125
Illyrio's no fool.

334
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,042
He knows I won't forget my friends

335
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,420
when I come into my throne.

336
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,510
You still slouch.

337
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,182
Let them see.

338
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,731
You have a woman's body now.

339

[Sighs]

340
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:46,625
I need you to be perfect today.

341
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,545
Can you do that for me?

342
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,677
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

343
00:34:58,637 --> 00:34:59,679
No.

344
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,398
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

345
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:11,483
they will say it began today.

346
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,884
It's too hot, my lady.

347
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:49,646
[Gulls crying]

348
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:00,074
Where is he?

349
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,077
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

Do you see how long his hair is?

359
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,076
When Dothraki are defeated in combat

360
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,788
they cut off their braid
so the whole world can see their shame.

361
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:51,750
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

362
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,088
He's a savage, of course,
but he's one of the finest killers alive.

363
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:00,592
And you will be his queen.

364
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,262
Come forward, my dear.

365
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:44,510
Where is he going?

366
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,347
- The ceremony is over.
- But he... But he didn't say anything.

367
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,599
Did he like her?

368
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:52,478
Trust me, Your Grace,
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

369
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,858
[Illyrio] It won't be long now.

370
00:37:57,983 --> 00:38:01,612
Soon you will cross the narrow sea
and take back your father's throne.

371
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,699
The people drink secret toasts
to your health.

372
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,286
They cry out for their true king.

373
00:38:12,831 --> 00:38:14,708
When will they be married?

374
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:18,378
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

375
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,755
Is it true they lie with their horses?

376
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,800
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

377
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,052
Do you take me for a fool?

378
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,887
I take you for a king.

379
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,141
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

380
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:32,976
My apologies if I've given offense.

381
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,688
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

382
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,606
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

383
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,568
I don't want to be his queen.

384
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,032
I want to go home.

385
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,034
So do I.

386
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,496
I want us both to go home,

387
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,833
but they took it from us.

388
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,751
So tell me, sweet sister,

389
00:38:57,876 --> 00:38:59,545
how do we go home?

390
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,423
I don't know.

391
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,800
We go home with an army.

392
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,179
With Khal Drogo's army.

393
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,393
I would let his whole tribe fuck you,

394
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,603
all 40,000 men and their horses too,

395
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,398
if that's what it took.

396
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,197
[Kisses]

397
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,208
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

398
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,545
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

399
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,090
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

400
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,094
He's so handsome.

401
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,972
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

402
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,184
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

403
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,978
Why would he say no?

404
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:01,023
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

405
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,192
He'd have to leave home.

406
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,862
He'd have to leave me.

407
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,989
And so would you.

408
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:12,451
You left your home to come here.

409
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,327
And I'd be queen someday.

410
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,831
Please make Father say yes!

411
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:19,750
- Sansa...
- Please, please!

412
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,753
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

413
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,884
[Music playing, people chattering]

414
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,972
[Laughter]

415
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,811
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

416
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,978
Come on!

417
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,856
Come here, you little beauty!

418
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,650
[Robert laughing]

419
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,958
Is he dead yet?

420
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,505
Uncle Benjen.

421
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:10,384
[Laughs]

422
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,717
You got bigger.

423
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,679
Rode all day.

424
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,391
Didn't want to leave you alone
with the Lannisters.

425
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,851
Why aren't you at the feast?

426
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,728
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

427
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,771
to seat a bastard in their midst.

428
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:26,983
Well, you're always
welcome on the Wall.

429
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,068
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

430
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,903
So take me with you
when you go back.

431
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,907
- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.

432
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:35,826
I know he will.

433
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,621
The Wall isn't going anywhere.

434
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,416
I'm ready to swear your oath.

435
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,670
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

436
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,713
We have no families.

437
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,550
- None of us will ever father sons.
- I don't care about that.

438
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,637
You might, if you knew what it meant.

439
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,476
[Sighs] I'd better get inside,

440
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,896
rescue your father from his guests.

441
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,983
We'll talk later.

442
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,744
[Tyrion] Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

443
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,041
What are you doing back there?

444
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,376
Preparing for a night with your family.

445
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,509
I've always wanted to see the Wall.

446
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,427
You're Tyrion Lannister,

447
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,096
the queen's brother?

448
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,889
My greatest accomplishment.

449
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,101
And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard,
aren't you?

450
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,733
Did I offend you? Sorry.

451
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,320
You are the bastard, though.

452
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,949
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

453
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,827
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

454
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,956
making you... the bastard.

455
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,085
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

456
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,047
Never forget what you are.

457
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,507
The rest of the world will not.

458
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,217
Wear it like armor...

459
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,304
and it can never be used to hurt you.

460
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:23,641
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

461
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,563
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

462
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,746
[Music playing, chattering]

463
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,456
[Laughter]

464
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,878
You at a feast...

465
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,505
it's like a bear in a trap.

466
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,092
The boy I beheaded...

467
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:02,347
- did you know him?
- Of course I did. Just a lad.

468
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,599
But he was tough, Ned,

469
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,976
a true ranger.

470
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,603
[Scoffs]

471
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,480
He was talking madness.

472
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,442
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.

473
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,860
The two he was with are still missing.

474
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,990
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

475
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,076
Maybe.

476
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:26,913
Direwolves south of the Wall,

477
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,248
talk of the walkers,

478
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,918
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

479
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:38,382
Winter is coming.

480
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,925
[They chuckle]

481
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,887
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

482
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,472
- How are you?
- I'm good.

483
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,849
[Laughter]

484
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:50,686
Is this your first time
in the North, Your Grace?

485
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,565
Yes. Lovely country.

486
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,697
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

487
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,369
I remember how scared I was when
Ned brought me up here for the first time.

488
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,164
Hello, little dove.

489
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,335
But you are a beauty.

490
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,753
- How old are you?
- Thirteen, Your Grace.

491
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,465
You're tall. Still growing?

492
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,425
I think so, Your Grace.

493
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,677
And have you bled yet?

494
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,266
No, Your Grace.

495
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,396
Your dress, did you make it?

496
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,442
Such talent.
You must make something for me.

497
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,405
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

498
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,615
I hear the same.

499
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,952
Your daughter will do well in the capital.

500
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,414
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

501
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,057
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

502
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,644
- I hope it's true.
- Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

503
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,981
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate
your new title, if you accept.

504
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,192
It would be good
to have you on the field.

505
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,695
The competition has become a bit stale.

506
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,072
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

507
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:25,739
Getting a little old for it?

508
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,576
[Chuckles]

509
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,744
I don't fight in tournaments

510
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,246
because when I fight a man for real,

511
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,123
I don't want him to know what I can do.

512
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,793
Well said.

513
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,505
- [Laughing]
- Arya!

514
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,550
It's not funny!

515
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,304
She always does this.

516
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,847
This was my favorite dress
and she ruined it.

517
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,434
She always does it
and it's not funny!

518
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,393
[Robb] Time for bed.

519
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,481
[Arya groans]

520
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,157
[Ned] I'm a Northman.

521
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:13,371
I belong here with you, not down south
in that rats' nest they call a capital.

522
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,166
I won't let him take you.

523
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,295
The king takes what he wants.

524
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,715
[Snorts] That's why he's king.

525
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,427
I'll say, "Listen, fat man."

526
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,596
[He laughs]

527
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,849
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

528
00:47:32,974 --> 00:47:34,893
"He belongs to me now."

529
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,690
How did he get so fat?

530
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:45,110
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink. [Chuckles]

531
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,612
[Knocking]

532
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,157
[Man] It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

533
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,536
Send him in.

534
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:57,164
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

535
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,793
A rider in the night...

536
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:02,086
from your sister.

537
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,429
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

538
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,224
[Door closes]

539
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:20,688
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

540
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,358
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

541
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,702
[Ned] What news?

542
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,789
[Catelyn] She's fled the capital.

543
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,668
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

544
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,670
By the Lannisters.

545
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,465
She says the king is in danger.

546
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,842
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

547
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,594
She doesn't know what she's saying.

548
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:57,016
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now
if the wrong people had found that letter.

549
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,311
Do you think she would risk her life,

550
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,021
her son's life,

551
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,523
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

552
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,617
If this news is true...

553
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:17,286
and the Lannisters conspire
against the throne,

554
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,831
who but you can protect the king?

555
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,208
They murdered the last Hand.

556
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,543
Now you want Ned to take the job?

557
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,547
The king rode for a month
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

558
00:49:28,673 --> 00:49:31,175
He's the only one he trusts.

559
00:49:32,677 --> 00:49:35,512
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

560
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,224
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

561
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,353
He owes him nothing.

562
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,483
Your father and brother
rode south once

563
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,235
on a king's demand.

564
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,280
A different time.

565
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,742
A different king.

566
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,289
- [Noisy chatter]
- [Drumming]

567
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:25,521
[Hissing]

568
00:50:30,735 --> 00:50:32,737
[Gasps]

569
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,432
When do I meet with the khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

570
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,978
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,
you shall have it.

571
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:08,148
- When?
- When their omens favor war.

572
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,818
I piss on Dothraki omens.

573
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,612
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.

574
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:26,958
- [Crowd ululating]
- [Grunting]

575
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:42,766
[Cheering]

576
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,360
[Speaks Dothraki] Iteo akkah
(?)

577
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:55,945
[Blades clang]

578
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:06,831
[Screams]

579
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:19,510
A Dothraki wedding without at least
three deaths is considered a dull affair.

580
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,181
[Laughing]

581
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:37,152
[Speaks Dothraki] {Jadi, zhey Jora Andahli.} - Come, Jorah the Andal
 - Great khal.

582
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,911
A small gift, for the new khaleesi.

583
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,456
Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

584
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,543
Thank you, ser.

585
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,922
Are you from my country?

586
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,090
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

587
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,927
I served your father for many years.

588
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:04,012
Gods be good, I hope to
always serve the rightful king.

589
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:29,914
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

590
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:32,791
from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

591
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,836
The ages have turned them to stone,

592
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,922
but they will always be beautiful.

593
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,842
Thank you, Magister.

594
00:54:50,536 --> 00:54:52,579
She's beautiful.

595
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,085
Ser Jorah, I...

596
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,963
I don't know how to say "thank you"
in Dothraki.

597
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,882
There is no word for "thank you"
in Dothraki.

598
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,030
Make him happy.

599
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,211
[Waves crashing]

600
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,425
- No.
- [Sobs]

601
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:33,597
Do you know the common tongue?

602
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,146
- [Pin clanks]
- No.

603
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,610
Is "no" the only word that you know?

604
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:49,447
No.

605
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,163
[Continues sobbing]

606
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,851
Rough night, Imp?

607
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,938
If I get through this without squirting

608
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,940
from one end or the other,
it'll be a miracle.

609
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,858
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

610
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:30,070
The greatest in the land -
my spear never misses.

611
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:33,115
It's not hunting if you pay for it.

612
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,210
Are you as good with a spear
as you used to be?

613
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:46,795
No, but I'm still better than you.

614
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,713
[Laughs]

615
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,425
I know what I'm putting you through.

616
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,219
Thank you for saying yes.

617
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,639
I only ask you because I need you.

618
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:01,393
You're a loyal friend. You hear me?

619
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:04,063
A loyal friend.

620
00:58:04,188 --> 00:58:05,856
The last one I've got.

621
00:58:07,608 --> 00:58:09,777
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

622
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,282
And I'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

623
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,869
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boar!

624
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,588
Come on, you.

625
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,980
[Whines]

626
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,489
[Grunts]

627
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,246
[Barks softly]

628
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,420
[Woman gasping]

629
00:59:14,675 --> 00:59:16,302
[Woman moaning]

630
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,105
[Grunting, moaning]

631
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:45,831
[Gasps]

632
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,751
- Stop! Stop.
- [Gasps]

633
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,882
Are you completely mad?

634
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,510
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

635
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,679
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

636
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,931
I heard you the first time.

637
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:05,726
[Whimpers]

638
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:09,355
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

639
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:13,442
- How old are you, boy?
- Ten.

640
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,152
Ten.

641
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:26,329
- The things I do for love.
- [Gasps]

642
01:00:27,996 --> 01:00:32,329
OMG, DID THE KID DIE!??!?!

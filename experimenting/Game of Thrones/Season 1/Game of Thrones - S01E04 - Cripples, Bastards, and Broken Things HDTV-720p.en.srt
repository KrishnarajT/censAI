1
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,610
[Bird cawing]

2
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,331
[Nan] The little lord's
been dreaming again.

3
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,293
[Growling]

4
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,424
- We have visitors.
- l don't want to see anyone.

5
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,093
Really?
If l was cooped up all day

6
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,222
with no one but this old bat
for company, l'd go mad.

7
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,808
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

8
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,854
- l don't want to go.
- Neither do l.

9
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,771
I
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell

10
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,900
which means l do what he says,
and you do what l say.

11
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,069
Hodor!

12
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,659
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

13
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,787
Hodor.

14
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,337
[Tyrion] l must say l received
a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

15
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,049
[Robb] Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

16
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,759
Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not l, eh, boy?

17
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,138
l'm not your boy, Lannister.

18
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,348
l'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

19
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,727
- Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
- [Door opens]

20
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,688
So it's true.

21
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,860
Hello, Bran.

22
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,236
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

23
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,781
He has no memory of that day.

24
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,450
- Curious.
- Why are you here?

25
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,622
Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

26
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:10,209
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

27
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,588
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

28
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,798
Well, l mean l did like to.

29
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,384
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

30
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,596
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

31
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,641
- l'm not a cripple.
- Then l'm not a dwarf.

32
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,725
My father will rejoice to hear it.

33
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,103
l have a gift for you.

34
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,105
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

35
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,528
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

36
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,990
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

37
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,077
- Will l really be able to ride?
- You will.

38
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,372
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

39
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,750
ls this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

40
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,379
l have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples, bastards and broken things.

41
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,632
You've done my brother a kindness.

42
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,718
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

43
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:06,932
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There's a brothel outside your walls.

44
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,893
There l'll find a bed
and both of us can sleep easier.

45
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,651
Couldn't resist some northern arse?

46
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,278
lf you like Redheads, ask for Ros.

47
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,322
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

48
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,701
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

49
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,911
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

50
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,250
What happened here? Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

51
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,127
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

52
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,004
- Where did she go?
- M'lady's whereabouts...

53
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,632
M'lady? [Chuckles]

54
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,552
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.

55
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,637
Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

56
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:50,683
if he could see his only surviving son
has turned lackey?

57
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:54,687
l still remember seeing
my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.

58
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,483
- l believe your uncles were responsible.
- Must have been a pretty sight.

59
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,778
Nothing prettier
than watching sailors burn alive.

60
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:06,408
Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.

61
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,786
- We were outnumbered ten to one.
- A stupid rebellion, then.

62
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,290
l suppose your father realised that
when your brothers died in battle.

63
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,711
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

64
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,670
- Careful, Imp.
- l've offended you.

65
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,007
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

66
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,011
Anyway, don't despair.

67
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:28,305
l'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

68
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,682
and l've learned to live with it.

69
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,601
- [Coin clinks]
- Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

70
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,771
l'll try not to wear her out.

71
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,067
[Sighs]

72
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,028
[Jon] Shoulder, legs.

73
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,995
Leg, shoulder, leg.

74
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,997
Left foot forward. Good.

75
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:59,127
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.

76
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,629
What in seven hells is that?

77
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,259
- [Pyp] They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
- [Laughter]

78
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,302
Tell them your name.

79
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,389
Samwell Tarly,

80
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,393
of Horn Hill...
l mean, l was of Horn Hill.

81
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,103
l've come to take the black.

82
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,855
- Come to take the black pudding.
- [Laughter]

83
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,858
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

84
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,901
Rast...

85
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,028
see what he can do.

86
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,495
[Yelps]

87
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,788
[Whimpers] l yield.

88
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,457
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

89
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,711
Pick up your sword.

90
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,463
Hit him till he finds his feet.

91
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,341
[Samwell yelping]

92
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,764
[Whimpering]

93
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,516
lt seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.

94
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,353
- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jon!

95
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,771
- Again, harder.
- [Growns]

96
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,358
- [Shrieks] l yield!
- Enough!

97
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,403
- [Samwell sobbing]
- He yielded.

98
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,033
Looks like the bastard's in love.

99
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,870
All right then, Lord Snow,

100
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,165
you wish to defend your lady love,
Iet's make it an exercise.

101
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,252
You two. Three of you
ought to be sumicient

102
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,588
to make lady piggy squeal.

103
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,673
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

104
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,721
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

105
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,986
Yield, yield, yield!
l yield.

106
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,534
We're done for today.
Go clean the armoury.

107
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,370
That's all you're good for.

108
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,875
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

109
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,086
[Spits]

110
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,716
- Did he hurt you?
- l've had worse.

111
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,804
You can call me Sam...
if you want.

112
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,933
- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier, you know?

113
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,645
- You're going to have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and fight?

114
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,024
l wanted to.

115
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,902
- l just couldn't.
- Why not?

116
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,614
l'm a coward.

117
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,784
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

118
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,870
You're right. l'm sorry.

119
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,749
l just...wanted to thank you.

120
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,720
A bloody coward.

121
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:58,932
People saw us talking to him.
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

122
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,850
You're too stupid to be a coward.

123
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,852
- You're too stupid to be a...
- Quick now,

124
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,855
before summer's over. [Laughing]

125
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,982
Come here!

126
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,366
[Horse neighs]

127
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,722
- [Neighs]
- Hyah, hyah!

128
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:47,022
[Jorah] Vaes Dothrak -
the city of the horselords.

129
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:51,652
A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.

130
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,279
- Best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.

131
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,698
- You shouldn't call them savages.
- l'll call them what l like,

132
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,577
because they're my people.
This is my army.

133
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,706
Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.

134
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,479
lf my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

135
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,149
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

136
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,068
The Dothraki have never
crossed the narrow sea.

137
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,363
They fear any water
their horses can't drink.

138
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,072
But if they did?

139
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,577
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

140
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,288
but the men
advising him are dimerent.

141
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,750
- And you know these men?
- l fought beside them once,

142
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,794
long ago.

143
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,255
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

144
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,633
He drove me from my land.

145
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,345
You sold slaves.

146
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,139
Aye.

147
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,019
- Why?
- l had no money

148
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,230
and an expensive wife.

149
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,149
And where is she now?

150
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,484
ln another place,

151
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,820
with another man.

152
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,245
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

153
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,914
They call you the last dragon...

154
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,625
They do.

155
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:36,005
You have dragon's blood in your veins?

156
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,133
lt's entirely possible.

157
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,720
[Chuckles]
What happened to the dragons?

158
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,889
l was told that brave men
killed them all.

159
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,938
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

160
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,482
The brave men rode them.

161
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,985
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

162
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,572
this world has ever seen.

163
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:05,034
The breath of the greatest dragon
forged the Iron Throne,

164
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,038
which the Usurper is
keeping warm for me.

165
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,125
The swords of the vanquished,

166
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,378
a thousand of them...

167
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:18,841
melted together
like so many candles.

168
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,931
l have always wanted
to see a dragon.

169
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,559
There's nothing in the world
that l would rather see.

170
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,229
Really. Why dragons?

171
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,815
They can fly.

172
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,900
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

173
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,486
and they're somewhere else...

174
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,655
far away.

175
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,536
And they can kill.

176
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:52,749
Anyone or anything
that tries to hurt them

177
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,461
- gets burned away to nothing...
- [Gasps]

178
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,297
..melted...

179
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,216
like so many candles.

180
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,926
Ow.

181
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,890
Yes. Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.

182
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,018
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

183
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,729
l imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.

184
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,648
l was not locked in.
l have seen things.

185
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,482
- What have you seen?
- l've seen...

186
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,486
a man from Asshai
with a dagger of real dragonglass.

187
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,489
- Ooh.
- l've seen a man who could

188
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,286
change his face the way
that other men change their clothes.

189
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,998
And l've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

190
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:37,586
and whose ship had
sails of coloured silk.

191
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,880
So...

192
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,467
have you seen one?

193
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,638
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

194
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,640
No.

195
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,269
No, the last one died
many years before l was born.

196
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,438
l'll tell you what l have seen -

197
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,734
their skulls.

198
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,820
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

199
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,364
When l was very young,
just three or four,

200
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,990
my father used
to walk me down the rows

201
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,369
and l'd recite
their names for him.

202
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:14,163
When l got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

203
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,167
The ones closest to the door
were the last ones they were able to hatch

204
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,838
and they were all stunted and wrong
with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

205
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:27,469
But... But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

206
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,847
they got bigger

207
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,975
and bigger and bigger.

208
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,273
There was Ghiscar

209
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,859
and Valryon,

210
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,735
Vermithrax,

211
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,028
Essovius... [Gasps]

212
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,573
I
..Archonei

213
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,994
Meraxes,

214
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,038
Vhagar...

215
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,793
- and Balerion the Dread...
- [Moans]

216
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:04,965
..whose fire forged
the Seven Kingdoms

217
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,134
into one.

218
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,974
What happened to the skulls?

219
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,561
l don't know.

220
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,938
The Usurper had them
smashed to powder, l expect.

221
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,900
Scattered to the wind.

222
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,823
- That's very sad.
- Yes, it is.

223
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,245
What did l buy you for?

224
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,539
- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.

225
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,919
To, uh, teach your sister.

226
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,048
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

227
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,342
You think l bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?

228
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,767
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

229
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,684
[Chuckles]

230
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,937
Go on, then.
Get on with it.

231
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:15,993
Someday your husband will sit there
and you will sit by his side.

232
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:21,583
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

233
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:26,337
All the lords of Westeros
will gather here to see the little prince.

234
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,548
- What if l have a girl?
- Gods be good,

235
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,593
you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

236
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,804
What if l only have girls?

237
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,806
l wouldn't worry about that.

238
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,101
Jeyne Poole's mother
had five children - all of them girls.

239
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,144
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

240
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,605
But what if?

241
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:47,025
Well, if you only had girls,

242
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,653
l suppose the throne would pass
to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

243
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,448
And everyone would hate me.

244
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,616
Nobody could ever hate you.

245
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,494
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

246
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,998
Why would you say such a thing?

247
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,917
That business with the wolves? Sansa...

248
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,961
l've told you
a hundred times -

249
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,964
- a direwolf is not...
- Please shut up about it.

250
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,218
Do you remember your lessons?

251
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:20,017
- Who built the Iron Throne?
- Aegon the Conqueror.

252
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,686
- And who built the Red Keep?
- Maegor the Cruel.

253
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,605
And how many years
did it take to build...

254
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,027
My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

255
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:33,404
They were killed
on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

256
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:37,784
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

257
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,621
Why were they killed?

258
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,249
You should speak to your father
about these matters.

259
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,460
l don't want to speak
to my father, ever.

260
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,712
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

261
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,467
- to forgive your father.
- No, l won't.

262
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,970
[Man] It's the Hand's Tournament
that's causing all this trouble, my lords.

263
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:02,308
The King's Tournament.
l assure you the Hand wants no part of it.

264
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,435
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser,

265
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,689
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

266
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,651
Last night we had
a tavern riot, a brothel fire,

267
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,737
three stabbings and a drunken horse race
down the Street of Sisters.

268
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,531
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the king's peace,

269
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:19,660
perhaps the City Watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

270
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,369
- l need more men.
- [Ned] You'll get 50.

271
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,373
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- l will?

272
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,917
You found money for a champion's purse,
you can find money to keep the peace.

273
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,963
l'll also give you
20 of my household guard

274
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,467
- till the crowds have left.
- Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.

275
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,345
They will be put to good use.

276
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,472
The sooner this is over, the better.

277
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,308
The realm prospers
from such events, my lord.

278
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,564
They give the great a chance at glory,
and the lowly a respite from their woes.

279
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,441
[Littlefinger] And every inn
in the city is full

280
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,442
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

281
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,945
l'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

282
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,531
- Hmm.
- Now...

283
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,076
if there's nothing else, my lords?

284
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,880
Oh, this heat.

285
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,798
On days like this,
l envy you northerners,

286
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,719
yOUr SUmmer SnOWS.
Until tomorrow, my lord.

287
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,512
l've been hoping
to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

288
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,307
Lord Arryn?

289
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:28,979
Oh, his death was
a great sadness to all of us.

290
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:34,108
l took personal charge of his care,
but l could not save him.

291
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:39,990
His sickness struck him
very hard and very fast.

292
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,619
l saw him in my chambers
just the night before he passed.

293
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:49,583
- Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
- Why?

294
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,378
l have been grand maester
for many years.

295
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:57,590
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since...

296
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,594
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

297
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,055
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.

298
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:06,432
A book? What book?

299
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,938
Oh, l fear it would be
of little interest to you, my lord.

300
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,565
A... A ponderous tome.

301
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:17,109
No, l'd like to read it.

302
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,532
The Lineages and Histories

303
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,826
of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

304
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,955
with descriptions
of many high lords

305
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,084
and noble ladies

306
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,252
and their children.

307
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,896
Harkon Umber
first of his name,

308
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,692
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

309
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,362
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

310
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,699
at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

311
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,160
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

312
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,496
of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.

313
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,291
As l said, my lord,
a ponderous read.

314
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,002
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

315
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,922
He did not, my lord.
And l did not presume to ask.

316
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,258
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

317
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,801
..did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

318
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,804
Nothing of import, my lord.

319
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:30,558
Oh. There was one phrase
he kept repeating.

320
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,979
''The seed is strong,''
l think it was.

321
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,315
- ''The seed is strong''?
- Mmm.

322
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,692
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

323
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:42,445
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

324
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,615
For all the weight they're given,

325
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:48,451
last words are usually
as significant as first words.

326
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,579
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

327
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,707
What else could it be?

328
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:58,878
- Poison.
- A disturbing thought.

329
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,256
No, no, no, l don't think it likely.

330
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:05,844
The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare...

331
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,638
l've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

332
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:13,101
Yes, women, cravens...

333
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,936
and eunuchs.

334
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,191
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

335
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:23,487
- Everybody knows that.
- Yes, yes, of course.

336
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,323
How that sort of person
found himself

337
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,451
- on the king's council, l will never know.
- l've taken enough of your time.

338
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,497
No trouble at all, my lord.
It's a great honour.

339
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,164
Thank you.

340
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,291
l'll find my own way out.

341
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,429
[Footsteps]

342
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,152
Syrio says a water dancer
can stand on one toe for hours.

343
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:06,153
lt's a hard fall down these steps.

344
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:10,534
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson
and every lesson makes you better.

345
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,289
- Tomorrow l'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats? Syrio says.

346
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,750
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

347
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,836
They're as quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

348
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,008
- You have to be quick to catch them.
- He's right about that.

349
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:30,220
Now that Bran's awake,
will he come live with us?

350
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,683
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

351
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,894
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

352
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,191
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

353
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:48,363
But someday
he could be lord of a holdfast

354
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:51,407
or sit on the king's council.

355
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:56,288
Or he might raise castles
like Brandon the Builder.

356
00:24:56,329 --> 00:25:00,666
- Can l be lord of a holdfast?
- [Chuckles]

357
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:07,715
You will marry a high lord
and rule his castle.

358
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:12,930
And your sons shall be knights
and princes and lords.

359
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:17,017
- Hmm?
- No.

360
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,061
That's not me.

361
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,574
[Wind whistling]

362
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,670
Hello.

363
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,757
Ser Alliser said l'm to be
your new watch partner.

364
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,052
l should warn you,

365
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,556
l don't see all that well.

366
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,558
Come stand by the fire.

367
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,811
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. l'm fine.

368
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:04,605
You're not. You're freezing.

369
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,413
l don't like high places.

370
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:23,375
You can't fight. You can't see.

371
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,878
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

372
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,923
What are you doing here, Sam?

373
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,182
On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.

374
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:42,685
''You're almost a man now,'' he said.

375
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,023
''But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

376
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,651
''Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

377
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,154
''forsake all claim
to your inheritance and start north.

378
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,534
''lf you do not,'' he said,

379
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,996
''then we'll have a hunt

380
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:04,208
''and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

381
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,126
''and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

382
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,339
''Or so l'll tell your mother.

383
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,842
''Nothing would please me more.''

384
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:23,602
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

385
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,604
- Yes, he is.
- [Groans]

386
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:28,231
l'm not going to get
any better, you know.

387
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:31,609
Well...

388
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,403
you can't get any worse.

389
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,240
[Both chuckling]

390
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:46,333
l hear you're reading a boring book.

391
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,167
Hmph.

392
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,963
- Pycelle talks too much.
- Oh, he never stops.

393
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,423
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

394
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:57,009
Not surprising.

395
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:01,682
Until recently, he was only
a squire - Jon Arryn's squire.

396
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:05,978
He was knighted almost immediately
after his master's untimely death.

397
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,105
Knighted for what?

398
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,733
- Why are you telling me this?
- l promised Cat that l'd help you.

399
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:15,069
Where is Ser Hugh?

400
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,865
- l'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

401
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,450
Do you see that boy there?

402
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:23,119
[Whispers] One of Varys's little birds.

403
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:26,832
The spider has taken a great interest
in your comings and goings.

404
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,834
Now look there.

405
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,836
That one belongs to the queen.

406
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:36,133
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

407
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:40,345
- Varys or the queen?
- No, she's one of mine.

408
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:46,184
ls there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

409
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,814
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, my lord.

410
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:56,153
Get a message to
this paragon of yours - discreetly.

411
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,822
Send him to question Ser Hugh.

412
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:02,951
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armourer in the city.

413
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,913
He lives in a large house
at the top of the Street of Steel.

414
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,414
- Why?
- l have my observers, as l said,

415
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,875
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

416
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:15,047
visit this armourer several times
in the weeks before his death.

417
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:19,509
Lord Baelish, perhaps
l was wrong to distrust you.

418
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:24,013
Distrusting me was the wisest thing
you've done since you climbed off your horse.

419
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,690
- [Hammering]
-. .22, 23,

420
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:37,611
24, 5, 6, 2T,

421
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:39,445
- 28, 29...
- Ser Hugh?

422
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,573
30, 31, 32...

423
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,909
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, l'm busy.

424
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:49,163
l'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark,
the Hand of the King.

425
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,792
- l'm the captain of his guard.
- l'm sorry. l didn't catch your name, Ser...

426
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:56,046
- No ''ser''. l'm not a knight.
- l see.

427
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,798
Well, it just so happens that l am.

428
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,554
[Continues counting]

429
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,890
[Jory] He said he'd be glad
to talk to the Hand himself.

430
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,184
- He's a knight, you see.
- Ah, a knight.

431
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,771
They strut around
like roosters down here.

432
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:16,775
Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.

433
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,609
You shouldn't be out here, my lord.

434
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:23,155
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

435
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:27,411
The former Hand did call on me,
my lord, several times.

436
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:30,497
l regret to say he did not honour me
with his patronage.

437
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:35,042
- What did Lord Arryn want?
- He always came to see the boy.

438
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,298
- l'd like to see him as well.
- As you wish, my lord.

439
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,299
Gendry!

440
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,387
Here he is.

441
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,473
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

442
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:52,435
Show the Hand
the helmet you made, lad.

443
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,993
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

444
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,038
Boy, this is the King's Hand!

445
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:14,540
- If his lordship wants the helmet...
- l made it for me.

446
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:18,336
- Forgive him, my lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

447
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,964
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

448
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,967
He just asked me
questions is all, my lord.

449
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,094
What kind of questions?

450
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:31,224
About my work at first,

451
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:34,394
if l was being treated well,
if l liked it here.

452
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:39,357
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

453
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,944
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

454
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,404
What did you tell him?

455
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:49,576
She died when l was little.

456
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,537
She had yellow hair.

457
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,789
She'd sing to me sometimes.

458
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,795
Look at me.

459
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,472
Get back to work, lad.

460
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:17,604
lf the day ever comes when that boy
would rather wield a sword than forge one,

461
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:21,107
you send him to me.

462
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:23,067
[Hammer banging]

463
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,571
Find anything?

464
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,825
King Robert's bastard son.

465
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,077
[Robert laughing]

466
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,538
- [Woman] He likes that.
- [Women laughing]

467
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:40,001
This is for the king from Lord Stark.

468
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:42,171
- [Robert laughs]
- Should l leave it with...

469
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:45,883
- Shhh. Listen.
- [Women laughing]

470
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:48,551
Do you hear them?

471
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:54,391
How many do you think
are in there with him? Huh?

472
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:56,934
- Guess.
- Three.

473
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,104
- [Laughter]
- Four.

474
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:03,442
He likes to do this when l'm on duty.

475
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,611
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

476
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:09,198
- [Door opens]
- [Laughter]

477
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,535
- Forgive me, my lord...
- Why do l have to forgive you?

478
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,037
Have you wronged me?

479
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:21,335
- We've met before, you know.
- Have we? Strange, l've forgotten.

480
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:25,087
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

481
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,923
Ah.

482
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,967
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

483
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,261
- Oh.
- One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

484
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,182
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

485
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:37,601
They stopped liking it at the end.

486
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,895
That was a proper battle.

487
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,232
Do you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?

488
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:48,362
With his burning sword?
l'll remember that till the day l die.

489
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:51,656
l saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

490
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,409
lt was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

491
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:57,871
- Theon? He's a good lad.
- l doubt it.

492
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,457
- [Laughter]
- [Door opens]

493
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,295
[Robert] l'll bet you smell
of blackberry jam!

494
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,257
Let me smell it. Come here.

495
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:12,802
Can l leave this with you?
The message from Lord Stark.

496
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:15,097
l don't serve Lord Stark.

497
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,309
[Laughter continues]

498
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,746
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

499
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:43,125
- With Sam.
- Ah, Prince Porkchop.

500
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,085
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

501
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,961
- Impossible!
- [Chuckles]

502
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,130
That's enough.

503
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:58,264
Sam's no dimerent from the rest of us.

504
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:01,893
There was no place for him in the world,
so he's come here.

505
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,438
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

506
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,273
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

507
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,860
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

508
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:13,487
- [Rast] You are in love, Lord Snow.
- [Laughter]

509
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:17,867
You girls can do as you please.

510
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,704
But if Thorne puts me
up against Lady Piggy,

511
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,873
l'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

512
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,166
[Laughter]

513
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,005
[Snoring]

514
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,393
[Panting]

515
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:45,853
[Growling]

516
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:48,648
No one touches Sam.

517
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:05,164
What are you waiting for?

518
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,134
Attack him!

519
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,646
You get in there.

520
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:35,070
Hit me.

521
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:38,407
Go on, hit me!

522
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:40,492
[Shouts]

523
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,994
- l yield!
- [Laughter]

524
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,954
Yield. Yield.

525
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,206
l yield.

526
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:52,545
You think this is funny, do you?

527
00:36:56,257 --> 00:37:00,971
When you're out there
beyond the Wall with the sun going down,

528
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,806
do you want a man at your back?

529
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,266
Or a snivelling boy?

530
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,193
[Sobbing]

531
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,326
You send this whore
to give me commands?

532
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,077
l should have sent you back her head!

533
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:27,414
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
l did as you asked.

534
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:30,541
Hush now. It's all right.
Irri, take her and leave us.

535
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,835
Yes, Khaleesi.

536
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:38,050
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do l have to tell you?

537
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:41,929
- You do not command me.
- l wasn't commanding you.

538
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,639
l just wanted to invite you to supper.

539
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:45,891
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

540
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:48,601
- l had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

541
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,561
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

542
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:53,106
This stinks of manure. All of it.

543
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:55,108
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

544
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:57,693
You would turn me
into one of them, wouldn't you?

545
00:37:57,777 --> 00:38:00,447
- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no right to a braid.

546
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:05,284
- You've won no victories yet.
- You do not talk back to me!

547
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:11,041
You are a horselord's slut.
And now you've woken the dragon...

548
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,378
- [Metal jangles]
- [Screams]

549
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,384
l am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!

550
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:25,514
l am the wife of the great khal
and l carry his son inside me.

551
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:29,393
The next time you raise a hand to me

552
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:32,563
will be the last time you have hands.

553
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:36,567
[Thunder rumbles, rain falling]

554
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:43,739
l know for a fact that some of the officers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

555
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:46,242
l wouldn't doubt it.

556
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,536
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

557
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:53,750
Making us take our vows while they sneak off
for a little Sally on the side?

558
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,253
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

559
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:59,715
What, we can't defend
the Wall unless we're celibate?

560
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:04,469
- It's absurd.
- l didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

561
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,264
Why not?

562
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:09,182
Because l'm fat?

563
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:12,686
- No.
- But l like girls just as much as you do.

564
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:16,440
They might not like me as much.

565
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:21,612
l've never...been with one.

566
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,532
You've probably had hundreds.

567
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:26,574
No.

568
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,661
As a matter of fact,

569
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,331
l'm the same as you.

570
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,458
Yeah. Yeah, l...

571
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:37,293
l find that hard to believe.

572
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,922
l came very close once.

573
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:43,132
l was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but...

574
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:47,554
- Didn't know where to put it?
- l know where to put it.

575
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,514
Was she...

576
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,724
old and ugly?

577
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,478
Young and gorgeous.

578
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,898
A whore named Ros.

579
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,027
What colour hair?

580
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:04,862
- Red.
- Oh, l like red hair.

581
00:40:05,947 --> 00:40:07,824
And her, um...

582
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,701
Her...

583
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,329
- You don't want to know.
- What, that good?

584
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,164
- Better.
- Oh, no.

585
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:21,338
So why exactly did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect...?

586
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:26,844
- What's my name?
- Jon Snow.

587
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,929
And why is my surname Snow?

588
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,932
Because...

589
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:35,393
you're a bastard from the North.

590
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,815
l never met my mother.

591
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,608
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

592
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:44,820
l don't know if she's living or dead.

593
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,326
l don't know if she's a noblewoman
or a fisherman's wife...

594
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,204
or a whore.

595
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:59,751
So l sat there

596
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:03,045
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

597
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:06,675
But l couldn't do it.

598
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:12,181
Because all l could think was
what if l got her pregnant

599
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:17,311
and she had a child,
another bastard named Snow?

600
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:24,735
lt's not a good life for a child.

601
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,945
Ah, mmm.

602
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,199
So...

603
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,994
you didn't know where to put it?

604
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:37,371
[Laughing]

605
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,835
Enjoying yourselves?

606
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:45,797
You look cold, boys.

607
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:48,800
- [Door creaks]
- It is a bit nippy.

608
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,719
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

609
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:53,804
indoors.

610
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,599
lt's still summer.

611
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:59,478
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

612
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:03,440
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

613
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:06,068
l remember.

614
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:08,612
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

615
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,697
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

616
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:14,117
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

617
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:17,079
- l build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

618
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:21,250
l spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

619
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,126
during the last winter.

620
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:28,130
lt was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

621
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:31,467
We heard a rumour Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

622
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:34,387
So we went out to look
for some of his men -

623
00:42:34,512 --> 00:42:37,139
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

624
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:40,768
The wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

625
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:43,021
Harder than you'll ever be.

626
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,606
They know their country
better than we do.

627
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,193
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

628
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:52,780
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

629
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:56,367
And we got caught in the open.

630
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,244
Wind so strong

631
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:02,416
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground, roots and all.

632
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,293
lf you took your gloves off
to find your cock to have a piss,

633
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:08,463
you lost a finger to the frost.

634
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,382
And all in darkness.

635
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,096
You don't know cold.

636
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:18,097
Neither of you do.

637
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:22,936
The horses died first.

638
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:28,650
We didn't have enough
to feed them, to keep them warm.

639
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:32,945
Eating the horses was easy.

640
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:37,992
But later when we started to fall...

641
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:41,829
That wasn't easy.

642
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:46,793
We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?

643
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,422
- [Grabs]
- [Gasps]

644
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,050
Soft, fat boys like you.

645
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:59,139
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you
and still had bones left over for soup.

646
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:04,728
Soon we'll have new recruits

647
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:08,106
and you lot will be passed along
to the lord commander

648
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,192
for assignment,

649
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:14,780
and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,

650
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,489
but you'd be fools to believe it.

651
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:20,077
You're boys still.

652
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:23,789
And come the winter you will die...

653
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:27,333
like flies.

654
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,925
l hit him.

655
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,427
l hit the dragon.

656
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,804
Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.

657
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:42,516
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

658
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:46,686
- He is still the true king.
- The truth now.

659
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:50,815
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

660
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:52,400
No.

661
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,528
But the common people
are waiting for him.

662
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,907
lllyrio said they are sewing dragon banners
and praying for his return.

663
00:45:00,032 --> 00:45:04,704
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

664
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:08,083
They don't care
what games the high lords play.

665
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,878
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

666
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,257
Home.

667
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:19,594
l pray for home too.

668
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:26,101
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

669
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:31,648
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

670
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:36,862
He'll never take us home.

671
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:40,199
[Crowd chattering and yelling]

672
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:48,123
[Horse whinnies]

673
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:58,967
Lovers' quarrel?

674
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,552
l'm sorry. Do l...?

675
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:03,054
Sansa dear
this is Lord Bae!lish.

676
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:05,306
- He's known...
- An old friend of the family.

677
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:08,351
l've known your mother a long, long time.

678
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:10,646
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

679
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:13,565
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

680
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,777
When l was a child, l was very small,

681
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,987
and l come from a little spit of land
called the Fingers,

682
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:24,242
SO yOU See,
it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

683
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:27,036
l've been sitting here for days!

684
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:30,706
Start the damn joust
before l piss myself!

685
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,835
[Crowd cheering]

686
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:41,050
Gods, who's that?

687
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:43,554
[Littlefinger] Ser Gregor Clegane.

688
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:46,556
They call him the Mountain.

689
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:50,853
The Hound's older brother.

690
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:54,106
- And his opponent?
- [Littlefinger] Ser Hugh of the Vale.

691
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:56,065
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

692
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,775
Look how far he's come.

693
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,114
Yes, yes, enough of
the bloody pomp. Have at him!

694
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:12,164
[Horse neighs]

695
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:43,780
[Screams]

696
00:47:44,822 --> 00:47:47,284
[Crowd gasps]

697
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:49,494
[Gurgling]

698
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:57,418
[Fly buzzing]

699
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:24,112
Not what you were expecting?

700
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:31,244
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

701
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:35,039
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

702
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,670
The Hound was just a pup,

703
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,963
six years old maybe.

704
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:44,090
Gregor a few years older,

705
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:47,969
already a big lad,
already getting a bit of a reputation.

706
00:48:48,052 --> 00:48:53,976
Some lucky boys just born
with a talent for violence.

707
00:48:54,101 --> 00:49:00,190
One evening Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the fire -

708
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:02,608
Gregor's toy,

709
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,362
a wooden knight.

710
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,364
Gregor never said a word,

711
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:10,449
he just grabbed his brother
by the scrum of his neck

712
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:13,871
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

713
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:17,623
Held him there
while the boy screamed,

714
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,876
while his face melted.

715
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:28,050
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

716
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:31,722
- l won't tell anyone. l promise.
- No, please don't.

717
00:49:31,804 --> 00:49:35,099
lf the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

718
00:49:35,224 --> 00:49:39,521
l'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing
would not be able to save you.

719
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:52,074
[Knocking]

720
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,369
My lord, Her Grace the queen.

721
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:01,168
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

722
00:50:01,293 --> 00:50:04,463
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

723
00:50:05,963 --> 00:50:09,384
l thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us -

724
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:12,137
the ugliness with the wolves.

725
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:15,932
And forcing you to kill the beast
was extreme.

726
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:20,728
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

727
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,731
How is Sansa?

728
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,735
- She likes it here.
- She's the only Stark who does.

729
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,782
Favours her mother
not much of the North in' her.

730
00:50:31,864 --> 00:50:35,577
- What are you doing here?
- l might ask the same of you.

731
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:37,788
What is it you hope to accomplish?

732
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:40,748
The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,

733
00:50:40,873 --> 00:50:43,251
and that's what l'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

734
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:46,003
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

735
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:48,757
He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.

736
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:51,635
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

737
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,387
lf that's my job, then so be it.

738
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:58,349
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

739
00:50:58,432 --> 00:51:02,061
You take your orders
and you carry on.

740
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:04,106
l suppose it makes sense.

741
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:07,275
Your older brother was trained to lead
and you were trained to follow.

742
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,487
l was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.

743
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,242
As was l.

744
00:51:20,621 --> 00:51:24,585
[Door opens, closes]

745
00:51:27,503 --> 00:51:29,547
[Horse snorts]

746
00:51:30,548 --> 00:51:32,675
[Dog barking]

747
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,137
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

748
00:51:37,054 --> 00:51:38,056
And to you.

749
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:40,349
Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

750
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:42,853
Ah, good idea, Grandfather.
l'm starving.

751
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:46,565
- A song while we wait or...?
- l'd rather throw myself down a well.

752
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:50,235
Now, now, Grandfather, this may be
your last chance if you're heading North.

753
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:53,405
The only music the northerners know
is the howling of wolves!

754
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,364
- [Laughs]
- [Door opens]

755
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:57,034
Gods.

756
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,702
l'm sorry, my lord. We're full up.

757
00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:01,663
- Every room.
- [Tyrion] My men can sleep in the stable.

758
00:52:01,746 --> 00:52:04,875
As for myself, l don't
require a large room.

759
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,963
- Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
- Is there nothing l can do...

760
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:12,465
- [Coin clanks]
- ..to remedy this?

761
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,844
- You can have my room.
- Now there's a clever man.

762
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:20,181
You can manage food, l trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

763
00:52:20,264 --> 00:52:22,226
- Aye, my lord.
- My lord of Lannister!

764
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,894
Might l entertain you while you eat?

765
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:27,773
l can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

766
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:31,527
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

767
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:35,780
Lady Stark!
What an unexpected pleasure.

768
00:52:36,447 --> 00:52:39,242
l was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

769
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:41,161
Lady Stark!

770
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:53,798
l was still Catelyn Tully
the last time l stayed here.

771
00:52:56,175 --> 00:52:58,387
You, ser.

772
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:03,599
ls that the black bat of Harrenhal
l see embroidered on your coat?

773
00:53:03,724 --> 00:53:05,184
lt is, my lady.

774
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:07,980
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest friend

775
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:12,108
to my father,
Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

776
00:53:12,233 --> 00:53:13,777
She is.

777
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,324
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

778
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:24,746
My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst
his oldest and most loyal bannermen.

779
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:27,416
Our lord is honoured by his trust.

780
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,460
l envy your father
all his fine friends, Lady Stark,

781
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:34,088
but l don't quite see
the purpose of this.

782
00:53:35,548 --> 00:53:37,550
l know your sigil as well -

783
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:41,471
the twin towers of Frey.

784
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:43,764
How fares your lord, ser?

785
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:46,268
Lord Walder is well, my lady.

786
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:49,980
He has asked your father for the honour
of his presence on his 90th nameday.

787
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:52,273
- He plans to take another wife.
- [Tyrion] Ha!

788
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,865
This man...

789
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:03,952
came into my house as a guest

790
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:07,956
and there conspired
to murder my son.

791
00:54:08,831 --> 00:54:11,293
A boy of 10.

792
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:16,215
ln the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

793
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,134
l call upon you to seize him

794
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:22,637
and help me return him to Winterfell

795
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:25,097
to await the king's justice.

796
00:54:31,804 --> 00:54:36,097

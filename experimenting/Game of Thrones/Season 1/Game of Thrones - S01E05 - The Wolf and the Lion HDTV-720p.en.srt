所有骑士抽签决定, 史塔克大人.
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

24
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,414
是的.
Aye.

25
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:50,651
但是谁主持抽签?
But who holds the straws?

26
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:53,222
有劳你们了, 嬷嬷.
You've done good work, sisters.

人生真是变幻无常. 曾几何时

幸好我们没在战场上碰面, 巴利斯坦爵士.
I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan.

30
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:08,639
我妻子也该感到庆幸.
As is my wife.

31
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,675
她年纪轻轻的不应成为寡妇.
I don't think the widow's life would suit her.

32
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,044
你太谦虚了.
( Chuckles ) You're too modest.

33
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:15,447
我亲眼看见你打倒了许多勇武的骑士.
I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.

34
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,115
我父亲曾经告诉我
My father once told me

35
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:19,349
你是他见过的人中武艺最强的.
you were the best he'd ever seen.

36
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:22,219
他在武学方面从来不会看走眼.
I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.

你父亲是一个好人.

他几个月前还是侍从.

41
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:34,265
他怎么置办得起这样一套新盔甲?
How could he afford a new suit of armor?

42
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,768
也许艾林大人给了他一些钱?
Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money?

43
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,938
我听说国王今天打算参加比武.
I hear the King wants to joust today.

44
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:42,639
是的, 但这绝对不行.
Yes, that will never happen.

劳勃总是想做就做.
( Chuckles ) Robert tends to do what he wants.

46
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,146
如果每回都照国王的意思办,
If the King got what he wanted all the time,

47
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,781
恐怕现在还是天下大乱.
he'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.

48
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:58,256
这铠甲太小, 陛下. 穿不上的.
It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.

49
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,592
你是个愚蠢的婊子养的.
Your mother was a dumb whore

50
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:03,027
你听到没有?
with a fat ass. Did you know that?

51
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:09,167
瞧瞧这个笨蛋! 没有卵蛋, 没有脑子.
Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains.

连帮人穿铠甲都不会.
He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.

53
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:14,239
你太胖了, 所以穿不下.
You're too fat for your armor.

54
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:17,242
太胖? 太胖, 是吗?
Fat? Fat, is it?

55
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:20,478
你就这样对国王讲话吗?
Is that how you speak to your King?

56
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:25,550
( Laughing )

57
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:29,521
很好笑, 是吗?
That was funny, is it?

58
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:33,257
不, 陛下.
No, Your Grace.

59
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:36,427
不? 你不喜欢首相说的笑话?
No? You don't like the Hand's joke?

60
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:39,264
你让这可怜孩子无所适从了.
You're torturing the poor boy.

61
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:42,100
首相说了. 国王太胖了所以穿不下.
You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor.

62
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:45,237
去找个胸甲撑子-- 快去!
Go find the breastplate stretcher-- now!

63
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:50,308
"胸甲撑子"?
- ( Laughter ) - "The breastplate stretcher"?

64
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:52,677
让他上哪儿去找?
How long before he figures it out?

65
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,406
你杜撰出来的东西吧.
Maybe you should have one invented.

66
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,730
好了, 好了.
All right, all right.

67
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:58,516
你等着看吧-- 我还记得怎么使长枪.
But you watch me out there-- I still know how to point a Lance.

68
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,653
你不该参加比武. 让年轻人上吧.
You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.

69
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:05,024
为什么, 因为我是国王? 得了. 我只想打打人罢了!
Why, because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

- 那谁敢对你还手呢? - 谁都行啊.
- And who's going to hit you back? - Anybody who can.

71
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:10,528
- 反正最后还骑在马鞍上的-- - 一定会是你.

你的意思是那些胆小鬼会故意让我赢?
Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?

75
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:20,204

你的侍从... 是兰尼斯特家的孩子?
Your squire... A Lannister boy?

81
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:43,927
嗯. 一个大白痴,
Mm. A bloody idiot,

82
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:46,062
瑟曦坚持要我收他.
but Cersei insisted.

83
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,531
都要感谢琼恩艾林让我娶她.
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

84
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,701
"瑟曦兰尼斯特是个好对象," 他告诉我.
"Cersei Lannister will make a good match," he told me.

85
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:55,605
"你需要她父亲的支持."
"You'll need her father on your side."

86
00:05:57,308 --> 00:06:00,879
我本以为当国王可以做自己想做的事.
I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted.

87
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:06,451
够了. 我们去看他们比武吧.
Enough of this. Let's go watch 'em ride.

十分引人注目, 嗯?
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

92
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:20,899
快, 拜见国王! 快鞠躬, 一群废物!
Come, bow before your King! Bow, you shits!

00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,007
现在我该拿那一百金龙买点什么呢?
Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?

105
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,009

来自里斯的姑娘?

你本可以拥有一个朋友.

洛拉斯绝不是故意的.

<i>耍花招毫无荣誉可言.

你说我们是去临冬城.
You said we were riding for Winterfell.

我是说了... 很多次而且很大声.
I did... Often and loudly.

人人都知道: 兰尼斯特有债必还.

你能给我松绑吗?
Would you be so good as to untie me?

149
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:09,322
- 我为什么要这样做? - 为什么不?

152
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:14,727
或者我会先被影子山猫吃掉.

153
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:17,931
你完全不用担心影子山猫和山地部落.

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,956
- 我可不会暗下杀手, 兰尼斯特. - 我也不会!
- I am not a murderer, Lannister. - Neither am I!

164
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,725
谋害贵公子的事与我毫无瓜葛.
I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life.

165
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,826
- 那把匕首-- - 怎样的笨蛋
- The dagger found-- - What sort of imbecile

166
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:49,528
才会把自己的武器交给刺客用?

167
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:51,764
- 我把他嘴巴塞上吧? - 为什么?

168
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:53,665
因为我说得太有道理?
Am I starting to make sense?

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,634

173
00:12:20,128 --> 00:12:22,495
我要是死了, 你怎么查清真相?
If I die, what's the point?

174
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:29,269
( Neighs )

175
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:30,604

罗德利克?
Rodrik?

179
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:17,316
我没事, 夫人.
I'll be fine, My Lady.

180

<i>别让自己身上沾满血.
There's no need to bloody yourself.</i>

181
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,288
你第一次杀人?
Your first?

182
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:26,557
你需要找个女人.
You need a woman.

183
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:29,528
打斗之后找个女人最来劲.
Nothing like a woman after a fight.

184
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:33,466
她肯得话我也愿意.
I'm willing if she is.

185
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,835
( Laughing )

186

<i>- 不顾一切. - 那她为什么走?

228
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:34,990
我还不能告诉你,
( Sighs ) I still can't tell you,

229
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:37,192
- 但她很快就会回家. - 你知道她在哪儿?

那你怎么能保证她很快就会回家?
Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?

00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:58,981
- 射箭要用上腿部的力量. - 嗯.
- You need legs to work a bow. - Hmm.

237
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:01,717
如果提利昂大人设计的马鞍有效得话,

238
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:03,751
你可以学习在马背上射箭.

( Moans )

244
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:28,879

00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:31,481
你本不能到城堡里来.
You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.

246

我本以为你在这儿很有地位.
I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.

247

对你这样人的来说足够有地位了.
Important enough for the likes of you.

248
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:40,790
你可不是我见识过的唯一一个贵族.
You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.

249
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,759
还有谁, 小恶魔?
Who, the Imp?

250
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,662
我看他只是半个贵族.
I'd call him half a nobleman.

251
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:46,529
嫉妒了?
Jealous?

252
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,499

我一直很好奇.
I've always wondered.

256
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:59,376
- 你会吃惊的. - 嗯?
- Might surprise you. - Hmm?

257

他手指上的技巧也很好.
He's good with his fingers too.

258
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:04,548
还有他的舌头.
And his tongue.

259
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:07,250
给小费也很慷慨.
Generous tipper.

260

兰尼斯特家挥金如土.
I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

261
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:12,056
你嫉妒了.
You are jealous.

262
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,758
我来自葛雷乔伊家族.
I'm a Greyjoy.

263
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,027
我们统治铁群岛三百年之久.
We've been lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years.

00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,163
维斯特洛没有哪个家族敢看不起我们,
There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us,

265
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:21,098
兰尼斯特家也不敢.
not even the Lannisters.

266
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:23,535
那史塔克家呢?
And what about the Starks?

267
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:27,571
我八岁起就是史塔克大人的养子.
I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.

268
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:30,208
养子-- 听起来倒不错.
A ward-- that's a nice word for it.

269
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:32,676
你父亲曾反叛劳勃国王

为了族人的自由而战.
for the freedom of his people.

272
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:40,817
你父亲做了些什么? 干了一个厨娘, 生了一个婊子.
What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

273
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,420
你真是个开不得玩笑的孩子.
You're a very serious boy.

274
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:47,057
- 我可不是孩子. - 哦, 你是.
- I'm not a boy. - Oh yes, you are.

275
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:51,127
连你的命根子都是开不得玩笑的.
A serious boy with a serious cock.

276
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:53,730
我不打算付你钱了.
I don't want to pay for it.

277
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,767
那你还是去找个老婆吧.
Then get yourself a wife.

278
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:02,339
<i>来吧.
- Arya: Come on. - ( Meows )</i>

279
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:06,144
我不会伤害你的.
- I'm not gonna hurt you. - ( Meows )

280
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:12,316
( Meows )

281
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:16,053
你的儿子怎么样了, 大人?
How is your son, My Lord?

282
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:19,088
他再也不能走路了.
He'll never walk again.

283
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:22,926
他的神志清醒了?
But his mind is sound?

284
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:25,128
是这样.
So they say.

285
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:27,597
那还算幸运.
A blessing then.

286
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:32,604
我也是在很小时身体就残缺了.
I suffered an early mutilation myself.

287

有些门对我来说永远关闭...
Some doors close forever...

288
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:40,447
另外一些却意外地向我开启.
Others open in the most unexpected places.

289
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:44,151
我可以坐下吗?
May I?

290
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,659
如果我将要告诉你的事被别人听到,
If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you,

291
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:53,827
我可能会掉脑袋.
off comes my head.

292
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:56,497
那时谁会为可怜的瓦里斯哀悼呢?
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

293
00:18:56,531 --> 00:19:00,201
天南地北, 没有人会为蜘蛛而歌唱啊.
North or South, they sing no songs for spiders.

294
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,769
但有些事必须让你知道.
But there are things you must know.

295
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:05,873
你是国王之手, 而国王是个蠢才--
You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool--

296
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:08,142
我知道他是你的朋友, 但他确实是个蠢才--
your friend, I know, but a fool--

297
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:11,144
注定要完蛋, 除非你能救他.
and doomed unless you save him.

298
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:13,479
我到都城已经一个月了.
I've been in the capital a month.

299
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:17,449
为什么你等到现在才告诉我这些?
Why have you waited so long to tell me this?

300
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,617
因为我不信任你.
I didn't trust you.

301
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:21,986
那现在你为什么又信任我?
So why do you trust me now?

302
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,221
并非只有王后一个人
The Queen is not the only one

303
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:26,656
在密切注视你的行动.
who has been watching you closely.

304
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:29,226
在都城里注重荣誉的人屈指可数.
There are few men of honor in the capital.

305
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:30,926
你是其中之一.
You are one of them.

306
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,996
我认为我也是其中之一,
I would like to believe I am another,

307
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:34,998
虽然也许令人难以置信.
strange as that may seem.

308
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:37,701
国王面临怎样的危险?
What sort of doom does the King face?

309
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:40,703
和琼恩艾林一样.
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

310
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,407
<i>那东西叫里斯之泪.
The tears of Lys, they call it.</i>

311
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:47,044
<i>非常罕见而昂贵,
A rare and costly thing,</i>

312
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:48,813
味道清甜如水.
as clear and tasteless as water.

313
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:50,981
不留一点痕迹.
It leaves no trace.

314
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,761
是谁下的毒?
Who gave it to him?

315
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:04,699
无疑是某个与他非常亲近的人. 但是哪一个呢?
Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one?

316
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:06,401
可疑的对象太多了.
There were many.

317
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:09,136
艾林大人是个和蔼可亲的人.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

318
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:11,538
确有这么个孩子.
( Sighs ) There was one boy.

319
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:14,240
他的一切都是琼恩艾林给的.
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

320
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:17,077
那个侍从, 修夫爵士?
The squire, Ser Hugh?

321
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:21,249
可惜他死不逢时,
Pity what happened to him,

322
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:24,353
本来他的前途一片光明.
just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.

323
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:28,890
如果是修夫爵士下的毒--
If Ser Hugh poisoned him--

324
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:31,724
那是谁指使修夫爵士的?
who paid Ser Hugh?

325
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:34,927
某个出得起价钱的人.
Someone who could afford it.

326
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:37,330
琼恩一向与人为善.
Jon was a man of peace.

327
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:39,332
他当了十七年的首相--
He was Hand for 17 years--

328
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:41,500
十七年的太平时光.
17 good years.

329
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:43,336
为什么要杀他?
Why kill him?

330
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:47,773
他问太多问题了.
He started asking questions.

331
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:54,847
( Meows )

332
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:18,971
<i>他已经找到了一个私生子.
Man's voice: He's found one bastard already.</i>

333
00:21:19,006 --> 00:21:21,140
他还拿到了那本书.
He has the book.

334
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:23,175
<i>他迟早会查出真相.
- The rest will come. - ( Lock clicks )</i>

335
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,778
<i>等他查出真相, 他会怎么做?
Man #2: And when he knows the truth, what will he do?</i>

336
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:27,713
<i>只有诸神知道.
The gods alone know.</i>

337
00:21:27,748 --> 00:21:30,383
那群蠢蛋想杀他儿子.
The fools tried to kill his son.

338
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,552
更糟糕的是-- 他们搞砸了.
What's worse-- they botched it.

339
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:38,991
狼和狮很快就会打成一团.
The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats.

340
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:42,662
<i>- 我们很快就要开战了, 朋友. - 现在开战有什么用?
- We will be at war soon, my friend. - What good is war now?</i>

341
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:44,498
我们还没准备好.
We're not ready.

342
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:47,134
既然死了一个首相, 为什么不能死第二个?
If one Hand can die, why not a second?

343
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,903
这个首相和那个不同.
This Hand is not the other.

344
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:51,904
<i>我们需要时间.
We need time.</i>

345
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,575
卓戈卡奥是不会在他儿子诞生前就行动的.
Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born.

346
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:56,743
你知道这些野蛮人的德行.
You know how these savages are.

347
00:21:56,778 --> 00:22:00,448
<i>你要我 "拖一下". 我可要你 "快一点".
"Delay," you say. "Move fast," I reply.</i>

348
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:03,784
<i>这不再是一场两人游戏了.
This is no longer a game for two players.</i>

349
00:22:03,818 --> 00:22:06,319
<i>从来都不是.
It never was.</i>

350
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:28,575
最先到场, 最后离开.
The first to arrive and the last to leave.

351
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,445
我赞赏你的勤奋.
I admire your industry.

352
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,614
你真是悄无声息.
You do move quietly.

353
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:37,549
我们都有自己的特长.
We all have our qualities.

354
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:40,819
今天你看起来有点孤单.
You look a bit lonely today.

355
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:43,122
今晚你应该到我的妓院来逛逛.
You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening.

356
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,618
认识下当家小生.
First boy is on the house.

357
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:46,790
我想你是弄错了.
I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.

358
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,961
是吗?
Am I?

359
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:52,597
那些在你耳旁低语的小小鸟儿--
All those birds that whisper in your ear--

360
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:54,731
漂亮的小东西.
such pretty little things.

361
00:22:55,768 --> 00:22:58,234
相信我,
Trust me,

362
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:01,070
任何取向我们都能满足.
we accommodate all inclinations.

363
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:02,806
哦, 我相信.
Oh, I'm sure.

364
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,009
我听说雷德温大人喜欢很小的男孩.
Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.

365
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:09,345
<i>我重视美貌和见识--
I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion--</i>

366
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,048
两者同样重要.
both equally important.

367
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:14,818
我想美貌是一种主观感受, 不是吗?
Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no?

368
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,554
是不是真的
Is it true that

369
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:19,891
腾石的马隆爵士喜欢断肢者?
Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?

370
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:23,127
人的喜好千奇百怪.
All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.

371
00:23:23,163 --> 00:23:26,731
我听说过最可怕的传言是有关一位领主
And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord

372
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,768
喜欢新鲜的死尸.
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

373
00:23:28,803 --> 00:23:33,173
要满足这种喜好恐怕是相当困难.
Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination.

374
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:35,107
得有人专门--
The logistics alone--

375
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:38,510
去找漂亮的尚未腐烂的尸体.
to find beautiful corpses before they rot.

376
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:40,513
严格地说, 做这种事
Strictly speaking, such a thing

377
00:23:40,548 --> 00:23:42,816
违反国王的律法.
would not be in accordance with the King's laws.

378
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:45,417
严格地说.
Strictly speaking.

379
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:50,522
告诉我-- 是否有人在某处
Tell me-- does someone somewhere

380
00:23:50,557 --> 00:23:54,093
将你的卵蛋保存在一个小盒子里?
keep your balls in a little box?

381
00:23:54,127 --> 00:23:56,561
我常常感到好奇.
I've often wondered.

382
00:23:57,897 --> 00:23:59,798
你是否知道我不知道它们在哪里?
Do you know I have no idea where they are?

383
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,969
我们曾经如此亲密
- And we had been so close. - ( Chuckles )

384
00:24:03,002 --> 00:24:05,471
不用再说我了. 再说说看
But enough about me. How have you been

385
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:07,472
我们上次见面之后日子里你过得如何?
since we last saw each other?

386
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:10,276
是你上次看到我之后还是我上次看到你之后?
Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?

387
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:11,848
我上次看到你,
Now the last time  I saw you,

388
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:13,499
你正在和国王之手谈话.
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

389
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,714
- 你亲眼看到我? - 我亲眼看到.
- Saw me with your own eyes? - Eyes I own.

390
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,281
是为国事.
Council business.

391
00:24:18,316 --> 00:24:21,384
我们都有很多事要和奈德史塔克谈.
We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.

392
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,421
大家知道你一直都喜欢
Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness

393
00:24:24,454 --> 00:24:26,355
史塔克大人的妻子.
for Lord Stark's wife.

394
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,359
如果兰尼斯特家是谋杀史塔克家孩子的幕后主使
If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life

395
00:24:30,394 --> 00:24:32,409
而且如果有人说是你帮助
and it was discovered that you helped

396
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,554
史塔克家得出这个结论...
the Starks come to that conclusion...

397
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:39,403
如果王后听到了风声--
To think a simple word to the Queen--

398
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:41,940
- 想想就令人发抖. - 哦.
- one shudders at the thought. - Ooh.

399
00:24:41,974 --> 00:24:44,609
<i>你知道吗? 我想我上次看到你
But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you</i>

400
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:46,511
是在你上次看到我之后.
even more recently than you have seen me.

401
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:49,449
- 是吗? - 是的.
- Have you? - Yes.

402
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:51,284
今天稍早的时候, 我记得很清楚
Earlier today, I distinctly recall

403
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:53,720
看到你在史塔克大人的房间里和他谈话.
seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.

404
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:55,955
当时你在床底下?
Was that you under the bed?

405
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,857
而在那之后不久
And not long after that

406
00:24:57,892 --> 00:25:00,861
我又看到你陪同一位
when I saw you escorting a certain

407
00:25:00,894 --> 00:25:03,563
<i>远道而来的贵客...
foreign dignitary...</i>

408
00:25:03,596 --> 00:25:06,199
为了国事?
Council business?

409
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:09,803
当然你可以有住在峡海对岸的朋友.
Of course you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea.

410
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:12,338
毕竟你本人就是从那边过来的.
You're from there yourself, after all.

411
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:15,709
我们是朋友, 对吧, 瓦里斯大人?
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

412
00:25:15,743 --> 00:25:17,912
但愿我们是.
I'd like to think we are.

413
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:20,315
那么你可以想象我所承受的压力,
So you can imagine my burden,

414
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:24,219
恐怕国王会因我对朋友的同情而怀疑我.
wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies.

415
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:28,289
身处两难境地, 向左是忠于朋友,
To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend,

416
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:30,191
向右是忠于国家--
turning right loyalty to the realm--

417
00:25:30,226 --> 00:25:32,359
- 哦, 拜托你. - 我自己的处境
- Oh, please. - To find myself in a position

418
00:25:32,394 --> 00:25:34,662
<i>只要国王听说一个字--
- where a simple word to the King-- - ( Door opens )</i>

419
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:36,730
你们两个在策划什么阴谋?
What are you two conspiring about?

420
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:40,335
嗯, 不管是什么, 最好快一点.
Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up.

421
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:41,903
我兄弟要来了.
My brother is coming.

422
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:43,605
参加御前会议?
To a small council meeting?

423
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:46,641
来自远方令人不安的消息.
Disturbing news from far away.

424
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:49,277
你听说了吗?
Haven't you heard?

425
00:25:51,012 --> 00:25:53,315
<i>( Birds cawing, waves breaking )</i>

426
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,211
你快滚开. 这里不准乞讨.
Off with you. No begging.

427
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,048
我不是乞丐. 我住这里.
I'm not a beggar. I live here.

428
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,483
你是要我赏你两个耳刮子才听得懂?
D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?

429
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:27,419
我要找我父亲.
I want to see my father.

430
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:30,188
我还要搞王后咧, 那一定很爽.
I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.

431
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,056
你想找你父亲, 小子?
You want your father, boy?

432
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,258
他躺在某家酒馆的地板上,
He's lying on the floor of some tavern,

433
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,359
别人正朝他撒尿呢.
getting pissed on by his friends.

434
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,095
我父亲是国王之手!
My father is Hand of the King!

435
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,432
我不是小子. 我是临冬城的艾莉亚史塔克
I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell

436
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:43,060
如果你们敢碰我一下, 我父亲
and if you lay a hand on me, my father

437
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:44,625
会把你们俩的头砍下来插在枪尖上.
will have both your heads on spikes.

438
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:47,471
现在你是让我过去, 还是要我赏你
Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you

439
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,972
两个耳刮子才听得懂?
on the ear to help with your hearing?

440
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:55,346
你知不知道我派出一半的卫士去找你?
You know I had half my guard out searching for you?

441
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,317
你要向我保证以后不再乱跑了.
You promised me this would stop.

442
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:01,987
他们说他们要杀你.
They said they were going to kill you.

443
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,490
- 谁说的? - 我没看清楚,
- Who did? - I didn't see them,

444
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:06,792
- 但有一个是胖子. - 哦, 艾莉亚.
- but I think one was fat. - Oh, Arya. ( Sighs )

445
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:09,563
我没说谎! 他们说你找到了私生子
I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard

446
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:12,566
还有狼和狮将打成一团--
and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage--

447
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,267
好象还有什么野蛮人.
something about the savage.

448
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,669
- 你在哪儿听到的? - 在地下城,
- Where did you hear this? - In the dungeons,

449
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:18,107
在龙的头骨附近.
near the dragon skulls.

450
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:19,468
你去地下城干什么?
What were you doing in the dungeons?

451
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,308
抓一只猫.
Chasing a cat.

452
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:25,711
<i>( Knocks, door opens )</i>

453
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:27,078
抱歉, 大人.
Pardon, My Lord.

454
00:27:27,114 --> 00:27:29,248
<i>有个守夜人想要见你.
There's a night's watchman here begging a word.</i>

455
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,582
<i>他说有要紧事.
He says it's urgent.</i>

456
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:41,459
- 你叫什么, 朋友? - 尤伦, 打扰您了.
- Your name, friend? - Yoren, if it please.

457
00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:43,336
这一定是您的公子. 长得跟您真像.
This must be your son. He has the look.

458
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,461
我是女孩!
I'm a girl!

459
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,945
是班扬派你来的么?
Did Benjen send you?

460
00:27:45,962 --> 00:27:47,797
不是的, 大人.
No one sent me, My Lord.

461
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,066
我是来寻找守长城的人手,
I'm here to find men for the Wall,

462
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:51,862
看看这边地牢里有没等待发落的人渣
see if there's any scum in the dungeons

463
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,086
或许能在长城派上用场.
that might be fit for service.

464
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,404
哦, 我们会帮你征召新兵.
Oh, we'll find recruits for you.

465
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,905
谢谢您, 大人.
Thank you, My Lord.

466
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,409
但我来找您不是为了这个.
But that's not why I disturb you now.

467
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:03,346
您的兄弟班扬是黑衣军的一员--
Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black--

468
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,449
我和您一样是他的兄弟.
makes him as much my brother as yours.

469
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:08,419
我正是为了他才飞速赶来
It's for his sake I rode here so hard

470
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:11,055
<i>差点把我的马都给累死了.
I damn near killed my horse.</i>

471
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:12,789
还有其他人也在飞速赶路.
There are others riding too.

472
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,893
明天全城都会知道了.
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

473
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,627
知道什么?
Know what?

474
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,766
这事最好私下谈, 大人.
Best said in private, My Lord.

475
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:29,277
走吧. 我们等会再谈.
Go on. We'll talk more later.

476
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,912
乔里, 带她回房间.
Jory, take her safely to her room.

477
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:35,082
走吧, 小姐. 您听见您父亲的吩咐了.
Come along, My Lady. You heard your father.

478
00:28:40,587 --> 00:28:42,521
我父亲有多少守卫?
How many guards does my father have?

479
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:44,758
在君临这儿吗? 有五十个.
Here in King's Landing? 50.

480
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:48,161
你不会让任何人有机会杀他, 对不对?
You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?

481
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:51,431
您不必担心这个, 小姐.
No fear on that count, little lady.

482
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:59,072
- 怎么? - 是关于您夫人的, 大人.
- Well? - It's about your wife, My Lord.

483
00:29:00,674 --> 00:29:02,509
她抓了小恶魔.
She's taken the Imp.

484
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,154
( Neighs )

485
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,594
欢迎您远道而来, 史塔克夫人.
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

486
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:23,362
请问您是谁?
To whom do I speak?

487
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:25,397
瓦狄斯伊根, 艾林谷的骑士.
Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

488
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,400
艾林夫人知道您来访吗?
Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?

489
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,701
我们事先来不及通知.
There was no time to send word.

490
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:31,936
冒昧问一句, 夫人,
May I ask, My Lady,

491
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:34,673
<i>他怎么会和您在一起?
why he is with you?</i>

492
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,741
正是为了他的事.
That's why there was no time.

493
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,677
- 他是我的俘虏. - 他看起来不象个俘虏.
- He is my prisoner. - He doesn't look like a prisoner.

494
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,015
<i>我妹妹会决定怎么对待他.
My sister will decide what he looks like.</i>

495
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:45,183
是, 夫人.
Yes, My Lady.

496
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:47,420
她在家里.
She will at that.

497
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,894
鹰巢城. 据说它是无法攻破的.
The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.

498
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,230
给我十个勇士和几柄长枪--
Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes--

499
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,133
我保证搞定那个婊子.
I'll impregnate the bitch.

500
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,736
我喜欢你.
Tyrion: I like you.

501
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:17,512
史塔克大人, 请您前往
Lord Stark, your presence has been requested

502
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:19,914
御前会议厅出席紧急会议.
in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.

503
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,116
我需要先单独面见国王.
I need to see the King first-- alone.

504
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:24,586
国王已经在会议厅了, 大人.
The King is at the small council meeting, My Lord.

505
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:26,354
他正召你前去.
He has summoned you.

506
00:30:26,387 --> 00:30:29,557
- 是关于我妻子的事吗? - 不是, 大人.
- Is it about my wife? - No, My Lord.

507
00:30:29,592 --> 00:30:32,528
我想是有关丹妮莉丝坦格利安的事.
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

508
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:34,930
那贱货怀孕了.
The whore is pregnant.

509
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:37,900
- 你在谈论谋杀一个婴儿. - 我警告过你
- You're speaking of murdering a child. - I warned you

510
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:40,403
会发生这种事. 还在北境时我就警告过你,
this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you,

511
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,038
但你却充耳不闻.
but you didn't care to hear.

512
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,675
好吧, 现在你听清楚.
Well, hear it now.

513
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,980
我要他们死, 母子两个一起死.
I want 'em dead, mother and child both.

514
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,148
<i>外加那个笨蛋韦赛里斯.
And that fool Viserys as well.</i>

515
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,217
这样说够明白了吧?
Is that plain enough for you?

516
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,852
<i>我要他们一起死.
I want them both dead.</i>

517
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,421
你这样做会永远失去荣誉.
You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.

518
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,455
荣誉?!
Honor?!

519
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,157
我需要统治七大王国!
I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule!

520
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,961
一个国王, 七个王国.
One King, Seven Kingdoms.

521
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,430
你以为靠荣誉能统治七国吗?
Do you think honor keeps them in line?

522
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,898
你以为靠荣誉能保持和平吗?
Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace?

523
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:10,535
是恐惧-- 恐惧和鲜血.
It's fear-- fear and blood.

524
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,269
那我们和疯王还有什么区别.
Then we're no better than the Mad King.

525
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,305
小心, 奈德. 你小心点.
Careful, Ned. Careful now.

526
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:16,307
你要刺杀一个女孩子
You want to assassinate a girl

527
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,375
仅仅因为八爪蜘蛛听到一个谣言?
because the Spider heard a rumor?

528
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,311
不是谣言, 大人. 前朝公主确实怀孕了.
No rumor, My Lord. The princess is with child.

529
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,113
消息的来源呢?
Based on whose information?

530
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:24,480
乔拉莫尔蒙爵士.
Ser Jorah Mormont.

531
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:26,792
他现在为坦格利安家族效力.
He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.

532
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,251
莫尔蒙? 你这消息来源于
Mormont? You bring us the whispers

533
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:32,989
千里之外的一个叛徒, 能可靠吗?
of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?

534
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:36,058
乔拉莫尔蒙是个奴隶贩子, 但不是叛徒.
Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor.

535
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,496
我知道对重视荣誉的人来说区别不大.
Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.

536
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,199
他违犯了律法, 背叛了家族, 逃离了祖国.
He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land.

537
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,103
我们要听信这种人的消息去行刺?
We commit murder on the word of this man?

538
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,105
<i>如果他是对的呢?
Robert: And if he's right?</i>

539
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,173
如果她生下一个儿子呢?
If she has a son?

540
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:51,343
一个坦格利安率领一支多斯拉克大军...
A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army...

541
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:55,047
<i>- 那怎么办? - 狭海依旧隔在中间.
- What then? - The Narrow Sea still lies between us.</i>

542
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:57,215
我才不担心多斯拉克人
I'll fear the Dothraki

543
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,684
除非他们能教会他们的马在水上走路.
the day they teach their horses to run on water.

544
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,819
什么也别做?
Do nothing?

545
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:04,022
这就是你睿智的建议?
That's your wise advice?

546
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:07,159
等我们的敌人登陆了再说?
Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores?

547
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:10,028
你们都是我的重臣!
You're my council. Counsel!

548
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:13,897
来跟这满脑子荣誉的傻瓜讲讲道理.
Speak sense to this honorable fool.

549
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,934
我了解您的顾虑, 大人.
I understand your misgivings, My Lord.

550
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,637
我实话实说. 我们讨论的是件可怕的事
Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing

551
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,739
是件卑鄙的事.
we must consider, a vile thing.

552
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:26,008
然而我们这些冒昧为政的人有时必须
Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes

553
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:29,577
为了国家的福祉做一些卑鄙的事.
do vile things for the good of the realm.

554
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:32,815
倘若诸神真给了丹妮莉丝一个儿子,
Should the gods grant Daenerys a son,

555
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:34,583
整个国家将血流成河.
the realm will bleed.

556
00:32:34,617 --> 00:32:36,919
我对这个女孩毫无恶感,
I bear this girl no ill will,

557
00:32:36,952 --> 00:32:39,020
<i>但是倘若多斯拉克人真的入侵,
but should the Dothraki invade,</i>

558
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:40,923
会有多少无辜百姓死于非命?
how many innocents will die?

559
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:42,991
会有多少繁华城镇付之一炬?
How many towns will burn?

560
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:46,228
那么比较明智甚或比较仁慈的做法,
Is it not wiser, kinder even,

561
00:32:46,261 --> 00:32:48,663
会不会是让她现在死去
that she should die now

562
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:52,067
以使万千生灵能平安地活下去呢?
so that tens of thousands might live?

563
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:54,603
我们多年以前就该杀掉他们俩了.
We should have had them both killed years ago.

564
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:57,070
当你发现跟自己上床的原来是个丑女,
When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman,

565
00:32:57,105 --> 00:33:00,441
<i>最好的做法就是闭上眼睛赶紧办事.
best close your eyes, get it over with.</i>

566
00:33:00,476 --> 00:33:03,877
杀了她. 越快越好.
Cut her throat. Be done with it.

567
00:33:09,784 --> 00:33:12,653
我跟随你冲锋陷阵--
I followed you into war--

568
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:14,688
进行过两场战争,
twice,

569
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:16,958
从不怀疑,
without doubts,

570
00:33:16,992 --> 00:33:18,926
从无顾虑.
without second thoughts.

571
00:33:18,961 --> 00:33:22,565
但这次我不能跟随你.
But I will not follow you now.

572
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:24,967
和我一起长大的劳勃
The Robert I grew up with

573
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:28,570
绝不会在一个尚未出生的孩子的阴影下颤抖.
didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.

574
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,442
那么刺杀她的计划.
She dies.

575
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,711
我绝对不会参与.
I will have no part in it.

576
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:38,013
你是国王之手, 史塔克大人.
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

577
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,717
你必须听我命令, 否则我就另请高明.
You'll do as I command or I'll find me a hand who will.

578
00:33:49,892 --> 00:33:51,726
那我祝他胜任愉快.
And good luck to him.

579
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:54,328
我本以为你会比疯王强.
I thought you were a better man.

580
00:33:54,363 --> 00:33:56,632
滚. 滚, 去你的吧.
Out. Out, damn you.

581
00:33:56,665 --> 00:33:59,301
我受够你了.
I'm done with you.

582
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:02,305
快滚回临冬城去!
Go, run back to Winterfell!

583
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:05,143
否则我会把你的头砍下来插在抢尖上!
I'll have your head on a spike!

584
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,414
<i>我自己来, 你这傻瓜!
Robert: I'll put it there myself, you fool!</i>

585
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,952
<i>你认为你太善良了? 太骄傲太荣誉了?
You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable?</i>

586
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:14,753
<i>这是一场战争!
This is a war!</i>

587
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:18,757
我要带我女儿们一起走.
I'll go ahead with my daughters.

588
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,360
让她们准备好. 你去安排.
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

589
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,829
- 别向任何人透露. - 好的, 大人.
- Don't ask anyone for help. - Right away, My Lord.

590
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:24,998
贝里席大人想见您.
Lord Baelish is here for you.

591
00:34:27,135 --> 00:34:29,436
陛下他后来还接着骂了一通
His Grace went on about you at some length

592
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:31,706
在你离开之后.
after you took your leave.

593
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,675
其中还出现了 "背叛" 这样的字眼.
The word "treason" was mentioned.

594
00:34:34,943 --> 00:34:36,411
你有什么事?
What can I do for you?

595
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:38,211
您打算何时回临冬城?
When do you return to Winterfell?

596
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:39,554
怎么? 这与你何干?
Why? What do you care?

597
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,264
如果您明天傍晚还在这儿,
If you're still here come nightfall,

598
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,184
我想带您去见见琼恩艾林...
I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn

599
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,710
病倒前找过的最后一个人.
spoke with before falling ill.

600
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:47,887
如果您对此仍有兴趣得话.
If that sort of thing still interests you.

601
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,490
我没时间.
I don't have the time.

602
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:53,159
花不了一个小时的. 你决定吧.
It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.

603
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,262
把我们的所有人都找齐
Round up all the men we have

604
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:01,840
布置在女孩房间外面.
and station them outside the girls' chambers.

605
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:05,938
- 你手下最好的两个剑士是谁? - 海华和韦尔.
- Who are your best two swords? - Heward and Wyl.

606
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:08,673
让他们到马房找我.
Find them and meet me at the stables.

607
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,581
你未经许可把他带到这里来?
You bring him here without permission?

608
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:19,652
<i>让他弄脏我的家?
You pollute my home with his presence?</i>

609
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:22,489
( Suckling )

610
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:24,458
你的姨妈做了一件坏事, 罗宾,
Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin,

611
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:26,293
一件非常坏的事.
a very bad thing.

612
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:28,797
你还记得她, 是吧?
You remember her, don't you?

613
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:32,001
<i>他漂亮吧?
Isn't he beautiful?</i>

614
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:34,804
也很强壮. 琼恩很清楚.
And strong too. Jon knew it.

615
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:37,873
他的临终遗言就是 "种姓强韧."
His last words were "the seed is strong."

616
00:35:37,907 --> 00:35:39,407
他要大家都知道
He wanted everyone to know

617
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:42,710
<i>他儿子长大后会是个强壮的男子汉.
what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be.</i>

618
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:46,648
看看他, 全艾林谷的领主.
Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.

619
00:35:46,682 --> 00:35:48,416
莱莎,
Lysa,

620
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:51,521
是你写信告诉我关于兰尼斯特家的事,
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

621
00:35:51,554 --> 00:35:54,389
- 警告我-- - 我是叫你离他们远点!
- warning me-- - To stay away from them!

622
00:35:54,423 --> 00:35:57,393
而不是带他们来这里!
Not to bring one here!

623
00:35:57,427 --> 00:35:59,528
妈咪?
Mommy?

624
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:02,231
<i>- 他就是那个坏人吗? - 是的.
- Is that the bad man? - It is.</i>

625
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:04,266
( Creepy laugh )

626
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,070
他好小呀.
He's little.

627
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:09,606
<i>他是兰尼斯特家的小恶魔提利昂.
Lysa: He's Tyrion the imp of house Lannister.</i>

628
00:36:10,608 --> 00:36:11,974
害死你父亲的就是他.
He killed your father.

629
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:13,710
就是他谋杀了国王之手!
He murdered the Hand of the King!

630
00:36:13,744 --> 00:36:16,079
哦, 他也是我杀的?
Oh, did I kill him too?

631
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:17,947
<i>我还真是个忙碌的家伙.
I've been a very busy man.</i>

632
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:20,650
你最好管紧你的舌头!
You will watch your tongue!

633
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:23,420
这些都是艾林谷的骑士.
These men are knights of the Vale.

634
00:36:23,454 --> 00:36:26,289
个个都对琼恩艾林敬爱有加.
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

635
00:36:26,324 --> 00:36:27,990
个个都愿意为我牺牲性命.
Every one of them would die for me.

636
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:29,429
要是我有什么不测,
If any harm comes to me,

637
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,603
我老哥詹姆很乐意料理他们.
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

638
00:36:31,728 --> 00:36:32,802
你不能伤害我们.
You can't hurt us.

639
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,460
没人能在这里伤害我们. 告诉他, 妈咪!
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, mommy!

640
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:38,568
- 告诉他! - 嘘, 我亲爱的孩子.
- Tell him! - Shh shh shh, my sweet boy.

641
00:36:38,603 --> 00:36:41,103
他只是想吓唬我们.
He's just trying to frighten us.

642
00:36:41,137 --> 00:36:42,972
兰尼斯特家的人全都是骗子.
Lannisters are all liars.

643
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:45,976
<i>谁也别想伤害我的宝贝.
No one will hurt my baby.</i>

644
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,512
<i>妈咪...
Mommy...</i>

645
00:36:48,545 --> 00:36:51,414
我想看那个坏人飞.
I want to see the bad man fly.

646
00:36:52,684 --> 00:36:54,485
也许会的, 我的小宝贝.
Perhaps you will, my little love.

647
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,653
<i>这个人是我的俘虏.
This man is my prisoner.</i>

648
00:36:56,688 --> 00:36:59,690
<i>我不能任他受到伤害.
I will not have him harmed.</i>

649
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:03,262
瓦狄斯爵士,
Ser Vardis,

650
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:06,132
<i>我姐姐的小客人累了.
my sister's guest is weary.</i>

651
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:09,001
<i>带他下去休息.
Take him down below so he can rest.</i>

652
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:12,237
把他介绍给莫德.
Introduce him to Mord.

653
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:15,840
你去睡觉吧, 侏儒.
You go sleep, dwarf man.

654
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:18,976
好好睡觉, 小侏儒!
( Laughing ) Sleep good, little dwarf man!

655
00:37:21,813 --> 00:37:24,282
( Slams, lock clanks )

656
00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:35,161
( Wind gusting )

657
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,813
史塔克能保住脑袋算是万幸.
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

658
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:59,751
劳勃会发上几天的火, 但他不会做什么.
Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything.

659
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:01,318
他喜欢这个人.
He adores the man.

660
00:38:01,353 --> 00:38:03,121
你嫉妒了.
( Surprised ) You're jealous.

661
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,389
你确信这不会受伤吗?
Are you sure this won't hurt?

662
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:08,692
<i>除非我手滑.
- Only if I slip. - ( Scraping )</i>

663
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:13,596
- 你喜欢我这个样子? - 嗯.
- And you'd prefer me like this? - Mm-hmm.

664
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,431
如果你想要没毛的, 也许应该找个小男孩.
If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.

665
00:38:16,465 --> 00:38:18,233
我想要的是你.
I want you.

666
00:38:19,902 --> 00:38:23,103
我兄弟觉得任何没上过战场的人都不算男人.
My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

667
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,873
他对待我好象我是个被宠坏的孩子.
He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child.

668
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,976
哦, 你不是吗?
Oh, and you're not?

669
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:32,346
洛拉斯提利尔, 百花骑士?
Loras Tyrell, the knight of the flowers?

670
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,547
你参加过几场战争?
How many wars have you fought in?

671
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:38,052
哦, 你父亲为你这套盔甲花了多少钱?
Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?

672
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:40,655
别动.
Hold still.

673
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:43,891
劳勃和史坦尼斯总是说我不够强悍,
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough,

674
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:45,992
说我害怕看见血--
how I squirm at the sight of blood--

675
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:48,563
但看到那人在肉搏战被打下眼球确实很恶心.
you did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the melee.

676
00:38:48,597 --> 00:38:50,527
他的眼球还在眼眶外乱晃!
His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!

677
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:52,599
他学艺不精就不该上场肉搏.
He shouldn't have entered the melee if he didn't know how to fight.

678
00:38:52,668 --> 00:38:53,869
你说得轻松.
Easy for you to say.

679
00:38:54,536 --> 00:38:56,471
不是所有人都拥有剑术天赋.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

680
00:38:56,505 --> 00:38:59,005
这不是天赋. 不是什么人给我的.
( Groans ) It's not a gift. No one gave it to me.

681
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,175
我剑术好是因为我勤于练习--
I'm good because I work at it--

682
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,943
自我能拿棒子的时候起每天都练习.
every day of my life since I could hold a stick.

683
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:06,313
我也可以整天练习, 每天练习,
I could work at fighting all day, every day,

684
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:08,248
但还是不可能比得上你.
and still never be as good as you.

685
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:10,851
好吧, 我想这一不定.
Yes well, I guess we'll never know.

686
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:15,054
( Sighs )

687
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,797
- 所有地方? - 所有地方.
- Everywhere? - Everywhere.

688
00:39:22,831 --> 00:39:25,465
最后会怎样?
So how did it end up?

689
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,099
那个坦格利安女孩会死吗?
The Targaryen girl will die?

690
00:39:27,135 --> 00:39:30,269
必须这样做, 虽然不令人愉快.
It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

691
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,505
劳勃很关心这个.
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

692
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,373
每次他说要杀死她,
Every time he talks about killing her,

693
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:36,577
桌子都被敲得跳起来.
I swear the table rises six inches.

694
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,346
可惜他对他妻子没这么大热情.
It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.

695
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,081
他确实对她家的钱有深深的欲望.
He does have a deep, abiding  lust for her money.

696
00:39:42,117 --> 00:39:44,251
你无法小看兰尼斯特家--
You have to give it to the Lannisters--

697
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:46,186
他们也许是最傲慢最无聊的混蛋
they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts

698
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,887
令诸神都难以忍受,
the gods ever suffered to walk the world,

699
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:50,590
但他们的钱多得不象话.
but they do have outrageous amounts of money.

700
00:39:51,826 --> 00:39:53,994
我的钱倒也不少.
I have an outrageous amount of money.

701
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:55,994
没有兰尼斯特家那样多.
Not as much as the Lannisters.

702
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:58,297
但还是比你多得多.
( Laughing ) But a lot more than you.

703
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,300
劳勃要带我一起去打猎.
Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him.

704
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:04,668
上次我们去了两星期.
Last time we were out there for two weeks.

705
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,271
下雨时还在树林里打滚, 连续好几天,
Tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day,

706
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,773
为了能把矛刺进什么东西的肚子里.
all so he can stick his spear into something's flesh.

707
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,777
哦. 劳勃喜欢杀戮.
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

708
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,213
- 他是国王. - 嗯.
- And he's the King. - Hmm.

709
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:19,550
- 为什么他能称王? - 因为他喜欢杀戮.
- How did that ever happen? - Because he loves his killing.

710
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:21,887
他也曾经擅长杀戮.
And he used to be good at it.

711
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,889
你知道谁应该称王吗?
Do you know who should be king?

712
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:27,760
- 别开玩笑. - 我是认真的.
- Be serious. - I am.

713
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:30,096
我父亲会做你的后盾.
My father could be your bank.

714
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,998
我从未上过战场, 但我会为你而战.
I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.

715
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:34,932
我在继承顺位中排第四.
I'm fourth in line.

716
00:40:34,967 --> 00:40:37,768
劳勃在疯王的继承顺位中排第几呢?
And where was Robert in the line of royal succession?

717
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:39,268
乔佛里是个混蛋.
Joffrey is a monster.

718
00:40:39,293 --> 00:40:41,005
- 托曼才八岁. - 史坦尼斯呢?
- Tommen is eight. - Stannis?

719
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:42,934
史坦尼斯象只龙虾那样强硬古板.
Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

720
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:45,141
但他仍是我的哥哥.
He's still my older brother.

721
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:47,478
- 你干什么?! - 看一看.
- ( Gasps ) What are you doing?! - Look at it.

722
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,626
你割伤我了.
You cut me.

723
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,054
不过是血. 我们体内都有血.
It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

724
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,449
有时会流出一点.
Sometimes a little spills.

725
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,885
如果你成为国王, 你会经常看见血.
If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this.

726
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,721
你必须习惯.
You need to get used to it.

727
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,889
继续. 看.
Go on. Look.

728
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,494
人们爱戴你.
People love you.

729
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:07,831
他们愿意服侍你, 因为你待他们仁慈.
They love to serve you because you're kind to them.

730
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,032
他们希望靠近你.
They want to be near you.

731
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,706
你愿意做必须做的事情,
You're willing to do what needs to be done,

732
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,474
你也从不幸灾乐祸.
but you don't gloat over it.

733
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,744
你不喜欢杀戮.
You don't love killing.

734
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,581
是哪本书上写着: 权力...
Where is it written that power

735
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:28,384
是万恶之源?
is the sole province of the worst?

736
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:30,485
王座只属于...
That thrones are only made

737
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,820
仇恨和恐惧?
for the hated and the feared?

738
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:38,994
你将会是一个受人爱戴的好国王.
You would be a wonderful King.

739
00:41:56,215 --> 00:41:59,451
我很遗憾你和奈德史塔克的联姻没成.
I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out.

740
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:01,385
<i>你们本会是和睦的亲家.
You seemed so good together.</i>

741
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,456
我很高兴能做件让你开心的事.
I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.

742
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,061
没有首相, 一切将变得混乱不堪.
Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.

743
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:13,063
我想你的目的是
I suppose this is where you tell me

744
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:15,934
要我把这位子给你的兄弟詹姆.
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

745
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,603
不.
No.

746
00:42:17,637 --> 00:42:19,737
他不够严肃.
He's not serious enough.

747
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,706
我要为奈德史塔克说句话:
I'll say this for Ned Stark:

748
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,842
他足够严肃.
He's serious enough.

749
00:42:25,077 --> 00:42:27,878
就这样失去他值得吗?
Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?

750
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:30,014
我不知道.
I don't know.

751
00:42:32,652 --> 00:42:35,221
但是我知道这一点:
But I do know this:

752
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:40,324
如果坦格利安家的女孩说服她的马王丈夫发动入侵
If the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade

753
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,563
如果多斯拉克大军渡过狭海...
and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea...

754
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:48,132
我们将无法阻止他们.
We won't be able to stop them.

755
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,668
<i>多斯拉克人从不乘船, 小孩子都知道.
The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that.</i>

756
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:53,605
他们缺乏纪律. 他们没有盔甲.
They don't have discipline. They don't have armor.

757
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:55,606
他们没有攻城武器.
They don't have siege weapons.

758
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:57,474
你的把戏耍得真不错:
It's a neat little trick you do:

759
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,778
你动的是你的嘴唇, 说的却是你父亲的话.
You move your lips and your father's voice comes out.

760
00:43:00,813 --> 00:43:03,947
我父亲说错了吗?
( Huffs ) Is my father wrong?

761
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:10,155
让我们假设韦赛里斯坦格利安真的登陆了
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

762
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:13,659
带着四万多斯拉克哮吼武士.
with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.

763
00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:16,193
<i>我们可以退入城堡--
We hole up in our castles--</i>

764
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:18,963
<i>这是明智的对策-- 只有傻瓜
a wise move-- only a fool</i>

765
00:43:18,998 --> 00:43:21,900
<i>才会在开阔地带与多斯拉克人硬拼.
would meet the Dothraki in an open field.</i>

766
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:24,769
他让我们呆在城堡里.
They leave us in our castles.

767
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:28,306
他们会洗劫并焚毁城镇,
They go from town to town, looting and burning,

768
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,010
<i>杀死所有不能躲进城里的人,
killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall,</i>

769
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:35,079
<i>抢走我们所有的粮食和牲畜,
stealing all our crops and livestock,</i>

770
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:37,581
将我们的女人和孩子掠为奴隶.
enslaving all our women and children.

771
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,617
多久之后, 七国的百姓将不再支持
How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind

772
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:44,054
他们临阵退缩的国王, 胆小如鼠的国王
their absentee King, their cowardly King

773
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,523
躲藏在高墙后的国王?
hiding behind high walls?

774
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,393
七国的百姓会在多久之后认定韦赛里斯坦格利安
When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen

775
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:52,061
才是真正合法的君主?
is the rightful monarch after all?

776
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:55,532
但我们兵力还是比他们多.
We still outnumber them.

777
00:43:57,036 --> 00:44:00,539
五和一哪个更大?
Which is the bigger number: Five or one?

778
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,009
五.
Five.

779
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:05,679
五...
Five...

780
00:44:07,114 --> 00:44:09,083
一.
One.

781
00:44:09,117 --> 00:44:12,085
一支军队-- 一支真正的军队
One army-- a real army

782
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,389
通过一个领袖, 一个目标团结起来.
united behind one leader with one purpose.

783
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:21,695
而我们的目标已随疯王一起死去了.
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

784
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:23,929
现在我们的军队数量
Now we've got as many armies

785
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:27,534
只由我们口袋里的钱决定.
as there are men with gold in their purse.

786
00:44:27,568 --> 00:44:30,036
所有人都希望改变.
And everybody wants something different.

787
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,304
你父亲希望拥有世界.
Your father wants to own the world.

788
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,809
奈德史塔克希望跑回北境把他的头埋进雪里.
Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.

789
00:44:35,844 --> 00:44:37,443
你希望什么?
What do you want?

790
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:51,226
我们已经有九年没真正打过仗了.
We haven't had a real fight in nine years.

791
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,728
背刺不能算是战斗.
Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight.

792
00:44:53,762 --> 00:44:55,963
现在整个王国只有:
And that's all the realm is now:

793
00:44:55,998 --> 00:44:58,134
背刺和阴谋
Back-stabbing and scheming

794
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:01,871
拍马屁, 捞金子.
and arse-licking and money-grubbing.

795
00:45:01,905 --> 00:45:05,041
有时我不知道究竟是什么在维系着王国.
Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.

796
00:45:05,074 --> 00:45:07,443
我们的婚姻.
Our marriage.

797
00:45:07,476 --> 00:45:09,311
( Laughing )

798
00:45:17,454 --> 00:45:19,989
啊, 所以我们坐在这里
Ah, so here we sit

799
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:22,291
坐了十七年,
17 years later,

800
00:45:22,324 --> 00:45:24,960
<i>维系着一切.
holding it all together.</i>

801
00:45:26,128 --> 00:45:28,431
你不觉得累吗?
Don't you get tired?

802
00:45:28,465 --> 00:45:30,565
每天都累.
Every day.

803
00:45:31,768 --> 00:45:35,239
依靠仇恨能维持多久?
How long can hate hold a thing together?

804
00:45:35,273 --> 00:45:39,242
嗯, 十七年算是很久了.
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

805
00:45:39,277 --> 00:45:41,411
是的, 很久.
Yes, it is.

806
00:45:42,547 --> 00:45:44,414
是的, 很久.
Yes, it is.

807
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:51,621
她长什么样?
What was she like?

808
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:56,425
你从没问过她, 一次都没有.
You've never asked about her, not once.

809
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,827
为什么不问?
Why not?

810
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:02,197
起初, 即使是在私下提起她的名字
At first, just saying her name even in private

811
00:46:02,233 --> 00:46:05,969
我都感觉会使她重获生命.
felt like I was breathing life back into her.

812
00:46:06,003 --> 00:46:08,204
我想如果我不再提起她,
I thought if I didn't talk about her,

813
00:46:08,237 --> 00:46:10,672
她就会从你心里逐渐消失.
she'd just fade away for you.

814
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:13,409
当我明白这绝无可能的时候,
When I realized that wasn't going to happen,

815
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:16,146
我则是出于怨恨而不提起她的.
I refused to ask out of spite.

816
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:18,347
我不想给你带来满足感
I didn't want to give you the satisfaction

817
00:46:18,382 --> 00:46:21,652
让你觉得我心里放不下.
of thinking I cared enough to ask.

818
00:46:21,686 --> 00:46:25,056
最终我明白我的怨恨对你来说算不了什么.
And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

819
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,992
事实上你还很享受我的怨恨.
As far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.

820
00:46:28,027 --> 00:46:30,228
那为什么现在又问?
So why now?

821
00:46:31,764 --> 00:46:35,733
莱安娜史塔克的鬼魂还能怎样伤到你我呢
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us

822
00:46:35,768 --> 00:46:38,938
难道我们彼此伤害得还不够深么?
that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?

823
00:46:42,876 --> 00:46:45,510
你想知道可怕的事实么?
You want to know the horrible truth?

824
00:46:48,114 --> 00:46:50,750
我已经记不得她长什么样了.
I can't even remember what she looked like.

825
00:46:53,586 --> 00:46:58,492
<i>我只知道她是我唯一想要的人...
I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted...</i>

826
00:47:00,128 --> 00:47:04,099
有人将她从我手里夺走了,
Someone took her away from me,

827
00:47:04,134 --> 00:47:08,938
七大王国也无法弥补我的空虚.
and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

828
00:47:12,675 --> 00:47:15,378
我曾经也对你有过感觉, 你知道么?
I felt something for you once, you know?

829
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:18,280
我知道.
I know.

830
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:21,516
甚至在我们失去我们的第一个孩子之后.
Even after we lost our first boy.

831
00:47:23,117 --> 00:47:25,219
实际上那持续了很长时间.
For quite a while, actually.

832
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:31,092
<i>我们之前有过可能吗?
Was it ever possible for us?</i>

833
00:47:31,126 --> 00:47:33,961
有过这样的时候吗, 即使很短暂?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

834
00:47:40,702 --> 00:47:42,371
没有.
No.

835
00:47:46,376 --> 00:47:49,378
<i>这个答案让你感觉更好还是更坏?
Does that make you feel better or worse?</i>

836
00:47:53,784 --> 00:47:56,485
没有任何感觉.
It doesn't make me feel anything.

837
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:09,896
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

838
00:48:11,032 --> 00:48:14,335
她长得很像他, 不是吗, 大人?
She looks like him, don't she, My Lord?

839
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:18,273
她有他的鼻子, 他的黑发.
She has his nose, his black hair.

840
00:48:18,306 --> 00:48:20,275
对.
Aye.

841
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:22,443
您见到他的时候请告诉他, 大人.
Tell him when you see him, My Lord.

842
00:48:22,478 --> 00:48:26,494
如果您高兴的话, 告诉他她有多漂亮.
If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is.

843
00:48:27,485 --> 00:48:29,130
我会的.
I will.

844
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:31,713
告诉他我没跟过其他人.
And tell him I've been with no one else.

845
00:48:32,322 --> 00:48:35,625
我以旧神与新神之名起誓, 大人.
I swear it, My Lord, by the old gods and new.

846
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:37,960
我不想要金银珠宝,
I don't want no jewels or nothing,

847
00:48:37,994 --> 00:48:39,894
我只要他的人.
just him.

848
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:41,831
国王对我一直很好.
The King was always good to me.

849
00:48:41,864 --> 00:48:44,032
琼恩艾林来看你的时候,
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

850
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:45,934
他想要什么?
what did he want?

851
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:48,068
他不是那种人, 大人.
He wasn't that sort of man, My Lord.

852
00:48:48,103 --> 00:48:51,271
他只想知道这孩子是不是开心,
He just wanted to know if the child was happy,

853
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:53,474
是不是健康.
healthy.

854
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:58,211
很健康.
He looks healthy enough to me.

855
00:49:00,014 --> 00:49:02,315
这姑娘什么也不要.
The girl shall want for nothing.

856
00:49:08,257 --> 00:49:10,759
妓院是比商船好得多的投资,
Brothels make a much better investment than ships,

857
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:12,327
我发现...
I've found.

858
00:49:12,362 --> 00:49:14,931
妓女很少会沉.
Whores rarely sink.

859
00:49:19,137 --> 00:49:22,106
你对劳勃国王的私生子女知道多少?
What do you know of King Robert's bastards?

860
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,443
嗯, 简单地说, 他生得比你多.
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

861
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:28,045
<i>- 多多少? - 有关系吗?
- Ned: How many? - Does it matter?</i>

862
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,148
<i>只要上过的女人够多, 总有人会送你大礼.
If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.</i>

863
00:49:31,182 --> 00:49:33,318
琼恩艾林把他们都找出来了. 为什么?
And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?

864
00:49:33,351 --> 00:49:36,355
他是国王之手. 也许劳勃要他代为照顾吧.
He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

865
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:39,657
他这人充满父爱.
He was overcome with fatherly love.

866
00:49:42,528 --> 00:49:44,195
走吧.
Come.

867
00:49:50,268 --> 00:49:52,436
- 乔里! - 大人.
- Jory! - My Lord.

868
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:13,625
这么小小的一群狼.
Such a small pack of wolves.

869
00:50:15,494 --> 00:50:17,262
退后, 爵士. 这是国王之手.
Stay back, Ser. This is the Hand of the King.

870
00:50:17,297 --> 00:50:19,331
<i>曾是国王之手.
Was the Hand of the King.</i>

871
00:50:19,365 --> 00:50:21,000
现在我不知道他是什么--
Now I'm not sure what he is--

872
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:23,436
好象是某个遥远地方的领主.
lord of somewhere very far away.

873
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:25,905
你这是什么意思, 兰尼斯特?
( Running ) What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

874
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:28,306
躲到安全的地方去.
Get back inside where it's safe.

875
00:50:28,342 --> 00:50:30,041
我正在找我兄弟.
I'm looking for my brother.

876
00:50:30,077 --> 00:50:32,110
你还记得我兄弟吧, 是不是, 史塔克大人?

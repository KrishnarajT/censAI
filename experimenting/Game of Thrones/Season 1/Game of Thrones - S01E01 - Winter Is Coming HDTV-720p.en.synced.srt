Do the dead frighten you?

15

Our orders were to track the wildlings.

We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

"Our way is the old way"?

110
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:36,872
The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

111
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,294
Is it true he saw the white walkers?

112
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:45,299
The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.

113
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:47,967
So he was lying?

00:14:52,472 --> 00:14:54,808

It's a direwolf.

You will feed them yourselves.

141

And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

142
00:17:39,973 --> 00:17:41,683
What about you?

143
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,226
I'm not a Stark.

As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you...

you worry too much.

151
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:15,734
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

152
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:20,949
When we were seven and you jumped off
the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

153
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:25,453
100-foot drop into the water...
you were never afraid.

154
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:28,205
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told Father.

- But who would he tell?

My husband.

158
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:44,263
If he told the king, both our heads would be
skewered on the city gates by now.

159
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:48,934
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know,
it died with him.

160
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:51,645
And Robert will choose
a new Hand of the King,

someone to do his job while he's off
fucking boars and hunting whores.

162
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:57,152
Or is it the other way around?

163
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:01,030
And life will go on.

164
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,741
You should be the Hand of the King.

165
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:06,453
That's an honor I can do without.

166
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:08,203
Their days are too long,

167
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,998

All these years,

172
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:54,000
and I still feel like an outsider
when I come here.

173
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:57,503
You have five northern children.

174
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:01,049
You're not an outsider.

175
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,676
I wonder if the old gods agree.

176
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:06,805
It's your gods with all the rules.

- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

179

Jon Arryn is dead.

180
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:26,950
A fever took him.

181
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:31,997
I know he was like a father to you.

182
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:38,168
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

183
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:40,296
gods be good.

184
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:51,891
The raven brought more news.

185
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,395
The king rides for Winterfell...

186
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,232
with the queen and all the rest of them.

187
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:03,485
If he's coming this far north...

188
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:07,072
there's only one thing he's after.

189
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:10,577
You can always say no, Ned.

190
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:22,629
[Catelyn] We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

191
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:26,509
- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.

192
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:29,803
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

193
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,472
stature?

194
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:34,475
We've brought up eight barrels of ale
from the cellar.

195
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:35,809
Perhaps we'll find out.

196
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:37,770
In any case, candles.

197
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:46,820
Why is your mother so dead set on us
getting pretty for the king?

198
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:49,699
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

199
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:51,867
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

200
00:22:51,993 --> 00:22:55,454
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab
with his right royal prick.

201
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:59,501
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

202
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:01,920
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

203
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:03,754
[Laughter]

204
00:23:38,915 --> 00:23:41,584
- [Pup yaps]
- Gods, but they grow fast.

205
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,547
Brandon!

206
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:48,674
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

207
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,886
How many times have I told you?
No climbing.

208
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:54,972
But he's coming right now, down our road.

209
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:04,398
I want you to promise me,

210
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:06,192
no more climbing.

211
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,197
I promise.

212
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:17,412
- Do you know what?
- What?

213
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:19,747
You always look at your feet
before you lie.

214
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:21,790
[Chuckles]

215
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,667
Run and find your father.

216
00:24:23,793 --> 00:24:25,837
Tell him the king is close.

217
00:25:10,257 --> 00:25:13,635
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

218
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:26,105
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh.

219
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:28,148
What are you doing with that on?

220
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:32,654
- Go on.
- [Groans]

221
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,697
[Arya] Move!

222
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:55,425
[Neighs]

223
00:26:57,865 --> 00:26:59,699
Your Grace.

224
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:05,872
You've got fat.

225
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:14,213
[Laughter]

226
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:19,510
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

227
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:27,100
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

228
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:30,771
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.

229
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,235
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

230
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:38,863
[Robert] Who have we here?

231
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,574
You must be Robb.

232
00:27:44,536 --> 00:27:46,662
My, you're a pretty one.

233
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:49,956
Your name is?

234
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:51,459
Arya.

235
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:55,253
Oh, show us your muscles.

236
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:58,883
[Chuckles] You'll be a soldier.

237
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:04,180
[Arya] That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

238
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:06,432
[Sansa] Would you please shut up?

239
00:28:15,983 --> 00:28:19,861
My queen.

240
00:28:19,988 --> 00:28:21,989
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

241
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:23,950
We've been riding for a month, my love.

242
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:26,077
Surely the dead can wait.

243
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:28,078
Ned.

244
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:38,964
Where's the Imp?

245
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:44,470
[Queen] Where is our brother?

246
00:28:44,596 --> 00:28:46,347
Go and find the little beast.

247
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:50,393
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

248
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:53,855
One minute he was fine and then...

249
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:57,817
burned right through him,
whatever it was.

250
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:00,986
I loved that man.

251
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:02,446
We both did.

252
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:06,908
[Robert] He never had to teach you much,
but me? You remember me at 16?

253
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:08,869
- [Chuckles]
- All I wanted to do

254
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:11,622
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

255
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:14,876
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

256
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:17,627
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

257
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:19,588
[Both laugh]

258
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:22,049
[Sighs]

259
00:29:22,175 --> 00:29:24,218
I need you, Ned,

260
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:28,013
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

261
00:29:29,892 --> 00:29:31,684
Lord Eddard Stark...

262
00:29:32,644 --> 00:29:35,104
I would name you the Hand of the King.

263
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:41,693
I'm not worthy of the honor.

264
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:43,237
I'm not trying to honor you.

265
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:45,071
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

266
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:48,909
while I eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave.

267
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:50,869
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

268
00:29:52,414 --> 00:29:54,373
You helped me win the Iron Throne,

269
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,210
now help me keep the damn thing.

270
00:29:57,336 --> 00:29:59,712
We were meant to rule together.

271
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:03,674
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

272
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:06,219
Well, it's not too late.

273
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:09,555
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

274
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:13,059
We'll join our houses.

275
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:19,065
[Woman moaning]

276
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:32,078
[Sighs]

277
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:38,125
[Cup falls]

278
00:30:38,251 --> 00:30:41,212
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

279
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:42,421
[Giggles]

280
00:30:49,428 --> 00:30:51,763
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

281
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:53,516
I did hear something about that.

282
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:55,809
And the queen and her twin brother.

283
00:30:55,935 --> 00:30:58,980
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

284
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:00,982
And the other brother?

285
00:31:01,107 --> 00:31:04,318
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

286
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,238
and there's the clever one.

287
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:10,031
Mmm...

288
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:12,409
I hear they call him the Imp.

289
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:14,328
I hear he hates that nickname.

290
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:17,831
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

291
00:31:17,957 --> 00:31:20,209
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

292
00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:22,795
prone to all manner of perversions.

293
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:24,713
Clever girl.

294
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:28,300
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

295
00:31:29,636 --> 00:31:31,220
Have you?

296
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:32,722
- Already?
- Oh!

297
00:31:35,642 --> 00:31:38,351
- The gods gave me one blessing.
- [Laughs]

298
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:39,520
[Door opens]

299
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:45,734
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

300
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,530
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

301
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:51,699
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

302
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:54,993
but our sister craves your attention.

303
00:31:55,703 --> 00:31:57,704
She has odd cravings, our sister.

304
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,874
A family trait.

305
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,460
Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

306
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:07,423
- Don't leave me alone with these people.
- I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

307
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:10,885
And this is the first of many courses.

308
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:13,220
I thought you might say that.

309
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:15,972
But since we're short on time...

310
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:17,391
Come on, girls.

311
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:20,144
[Giggling]

312
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:25,148
See you at sundown.

313
00:32:25,274 --> 00:32:27,359
[Tyrion] Close the door!

314
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,540
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

315
00:32:44,418 --> 00:32:46,628
She should be on a hill somewhere

316
00:32:46,754 --> 00:32:49,089
with the sun and the clouds above her.

317
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:51,258
She was my sister.

318
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:53,051
This is where she belongs.

319
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:56,555
She belonged with me.

320
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,231
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

321
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:11,069
It's done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.

322
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:16,200
Not all of them.

323
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:19,619
[Gull crying]

324
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:29,088
[Man] Daenerys!

325
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:33,967
Daenerys.

326
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:36,095
There's our bride-to-be.

327
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:39,682
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

328
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:42,851
Touch it.

329
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:45,186
Go on, feel the fabric.

330
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:51,109
Mmm.

331
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,114
Isn't he a gracious host?

332
00:33:58,492 --> 00:34:02,163
We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.

333
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:04,165
Illyrio's no fool.

334
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,082
He knows I won't forget my friends

335
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,460
when I come into my throne.

336
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:14,550
You still slouch.

337
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,222
Let them see.

338
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:26,771
You have a woman's body now.

339

[Sighs]

340
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:46,665
I need you to be perfect today.

341
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,585
Can you do that for me?

342
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:56,717
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

343
00:34:58,677 --> 00:34:59,719
No.

344
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:09,438
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

345
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:11,523
they will say it began today.

346
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:36,924
It's too hot, my lady.

347
00:35:48,018 --> 00:35:49,686
[Gulls crying]

348
00:35:58,195 --> 00:36:00,114
Where is he?

349
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,117
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

Do you see how long his hair is?

359
00:36:41,322 --> 00:36:44,116
When Dothraki are defeated in combat

360
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:47,828
they cut off their braid
so the whole world can see their shame.

361
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:51,790
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

362
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,128
He's a savage, of course,
but he's one of the finest killers alive.

363
00:36:58,505 --> 00:37:00,632
And you will be his queen.

364
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:03,302
Come forward, my dear.

365
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:44,550
Where is he going?

366
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:47,387
- The ceremony is over.
- But he... But he didn't say anything.

367
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:48,639
Did he like her?

368
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:52,518
Trust me, Your Grace,
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

369
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:57,898
[Illyrio] It won't be long now.

370
00:37:58,023 --> 00:38:01,652
Soon you will cross the narrow sea
and take back your father's throne.

371
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:06,739
The people drink secret toasts
to your health.

372
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:09,326
They cry out for their true king.

373
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:14,748
When will they be married?

374
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:18,418
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

375
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:20,795
Is it true they lie with their horses?

376
00:38:21,547 --> 00:38:23,840
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

377
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:26,092
Do you take me for a fool?

378
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:27,927
I take you for a king.

379
00:38:28,054 --> 00:38:31,181
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

380
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:33,016
My apologies if I've given offense.

381
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:35,728
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

382
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:38,646
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

383
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:41,608
I don't want to be his queen.

384
00:38:46,697 --> 00:38:48,072
I want to go home.

385
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:50,074
So do I.

386
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:53,536
I want us both to go home,

387
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:55,873
but they took it from us.

388
00:38:55,998 --> 00:38:57,791
So tell me, sweet sister,

389
00:38:57,916 --> 00:38:59,585
how do we go home?

390
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,463
I don't know.

391
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,840
We go home with an army.

392
00:39:07,927 --> 00:39:10,219
With Khal Drogo's army.

393
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:14,433
I would let his whole tribe fuck you,

394
00:39:14,558 --> 00:39:17,643
all 40,000 men and their horses too,

395
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:19,438
if that's what it took.

396
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:28,237
[Kisses]

397
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:39,248
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

398
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,585
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

399
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,130
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

400
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,134
He's so handsome.

401
00:39:50,302 --> 00:39:53,012
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

402
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:56,224
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

403
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:58,018
Why would he say no?

404
00:39:58,143 --> 00:40:01,063
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

405
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:03,232
He'd have to leave home.

406
00:40:04,525 --> 00:40:06,902
He'd have to leave me.

407
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:10,029
And so would you.

408
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:12,491
You left your home to come here.

409
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:14,367
And I'd be queen someday.

410
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:17,871
Please make Father say yes!

411
00:40:17,996 --> 00:40:19,790
- Sansa...
- Please, please!

412
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:22,793
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

413
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,924
[Music playing, people chattering]

414
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,012
[Laughter]

415
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:38,851
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

416
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:41,018
Come on!

417
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:43,896
Come here, you little beauty!

418
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:45,690
[Robert laughing]

419
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:00,998
Is he dead yet?

420
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:07,545
Uncle Benjen.

421
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:10,424
[Laughs]

422
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,757
You got bigger.

423
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:14,719
Rode all day.

424
00:41:14,846 --> 00:41:17,431
Didn't want to leave you alone
with the Lannisters.

425
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:18,891
Why aren't you at the feast?

426
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:21,768
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

427
00:41:21,895 --> 00:41:23,811
to seat a bastard in their midst.

428
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:27,023
Well, you're always
welcome on the Wall.

429
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,108
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

430
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:30,943
So take me with you
when you go back.

431
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,947
- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.

432
00:41:34,072 --> 00:41:35,866
I know he will.

433
00:41:38,578 --> 00:41:40,661
The Wall isn't going anywhere.

434
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:43,456
I'm ready to swear your oath.

435
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,710
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

436
00:41:46,835 --> 00:41:48,753
We have no families.

437
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,590
- None of us will ever father sons.
- I don't care about that.

438
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:55,677
You might, if you knew what it meant.

439
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:01,516
[Sighs] I'd better get inside,

440
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:03,936
rescue your father from his guests.

441
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,023
We'll talk later.

442
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:19,784
[Tyrion] Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

443
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:25,081
What are you doing back there?

444
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,416
Preparing for a night with your family.

445
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:34,549
I've always wanted to see the Wall.

446
00:42:34,675 --> 00:42:36,467
You're Tyrion Lannister,

447
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:38,136
the queen's brother?

448
00:42:38,262 --> 00:42:39,929
My greatest accomplishment.

449
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:44,141
And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard,
aren't you?

450
00:42:47,605 --> 00:42:49,773
Did I offend you? Sorry.

451
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,360
You are the bastard, though.

452
00:42:55,654 --> 00:42:57,989
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

453
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:01,867
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

454
00:43:01,994 --> 00:43:04,996
making you... the bastard.

455
00:43:06,498 --> 00:43:09,125
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

456
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:12,087
Never forget what you are.

457
00:43:12,212 --> 00:43:14,547
The rest of the world will not.

458
00:43:14,674 --> 00:43:16,257
Wear it like armor...

459
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,344
and it can never be used to hurt you.

460
00:43:21,014 --> 00:43:23,681
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

461
00:43:26,143 --> 00:43:28,603
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

462
00:43:44,244 --> 00:43:45,786
[Music playing, chattering]

463
00:43:45,913 --> 00:43:47,496
[Laughter]

464
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:51,918
You at a feast...

465
00:43:52,878 --> 00:43:54,545
it's like a bear in a trap.

466
00:43:56,549 --> 00:43:58,132
The boy I beheaded...

467
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:02,387
- did you know him?
- Of course I did. Just a lad.

468
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:05,639
But he was tough, Ned,

469
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:07,016
a true ranger.

470
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:08,643
[Scoffs]

471
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,520
He was talking madness.

472
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,482
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.

473
00:44:13,608 --> 00:44:15,900
The two he was with are still missing.

474
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:21,030
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

475
00:44:22,032 --> 00:44:23,116
Maybe.

476
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:26,953
Direwolves south of the Wall,

477
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:29,288
talk of the walkers,

478
00:44:29,415 --> 00:44:31,958
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

479
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:38,422
Winter is coming.

480
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:39,965
[They chuckle]

481
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:42,927
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

482
00:44:43,054 --> 00:44:44,512
- How are you?
- I'm good.

483
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:46,889
[Laughter]

484
00:44:47,974 --> 00:44:50,726
Is this your first time
in the North, Your Grace?

485
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:53,605
Yes. Lovely country.

486
00:44:57,402 --> 00:45:00,737
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

487
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:06,409
I remember how scared I was when
Ned brought me up here for the first time.

488
00:45:08,621 --> 00:45:10,204
Hello, little dove.

489
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:13,375
But you are a beauty.

490
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,793
- How old are you?
- Thirteen, Your Grace.

491
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,505
You're tall. Still growing?

492
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,465
I think so, Your Grace.

493
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,717
And have you bled yet?

494
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,306
No, Your Grace.

495
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:32,436
Your dress, did you make it?

496
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,482
Such talent.
You must make something for me.

497
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:42,445
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

498
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:44,655
I hear the same.

499
00:45:44,782 --> 00:45:46,992
Your daughter will do well in the capital.

500
00:45:47,117 --> 00:45:50,454
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

501
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:10,097
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

502
00:46:10,224 --> 00:46:13,684
- I hope it's true.
- Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

503
00:46:13,811 --> 00:46:17,021
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate
your new title, if you accept.

504
00:46:17,148 --> 00:46:19,232
It would be good
to have you on the field.

505
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:21,735
The competition has become a bit stale.

506
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,112
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

507
00:46:24,237 --> 00:46:25,779
Getting a little old for it?

508
00:46:25,907 --> 00:46:27,616
[Chuckles]

509
00:46:27,742 --> 00:46:29,784
I don't fight in tournaments

510
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:32,286
because when I fight a man for real,

511
00:46:32,413 --> 00:46:34,163
I don't want him to know what I can do.

512
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:37,833
Well said.

513
00:46:39,212 --> 00:46:40,545
- [Laughing]
- Arya!

514
00:46:42,882 --> 00:46:44,590
It's not funny!

515
00:46:44,717 --> 00:46:47,344
She always does this.

516
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:49,887
This was my favorite dress
and she ruined it.

517
00:46:50,014 --> 00:46:52,474
She always does it
and it's not funny!

518
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:54,433
[Robb] Time for bed.

519
00:46:55,936 --> 00:46:57,521
[Arya groans]

520
00:47:05,529 --> 00:47:07,197
[Ned] I'm a Northman.

521
00:47:08,907 --> 00:47:13,411
I belong here with you, not down south
in that rats' nest they call a capital.

522
00:47:14,454 --> 00:47:17,206
I won't let him take you.

523
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,335
The king takes what he wants.

524
00:47:21,462 --> 00:47:23,755
[Snorts] That's why he's king.

525
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:28,467
I'll say, "Listen, fat man."

526
00:47:28,594 --> 00:47:29,636
[He laughs]

527
00:47:29,762 --> 00:47:32,889
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

528
00:47:33,014 --> 00:47:34,933
"He belongs to me now."

529
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:40,730
How did he get so fat?

530
00:47:40,855 --> 00:47:45,150
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink. [Chuckles]

531
00:47:45,277 --> 00:47:46,652
[Knocking]

532
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:49,197
[Man] It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

533
00:47:50,657 --> 00:47:52,576
Send him in.

534
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:57,204
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

535
00:47:57,331 --> 00:47:59,833
A rider in the night...

536
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:02,126
from your sister.

537
00:48:09,844 --> 00:48:12,469
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

538
00:48:12,596 --> 00:48:14,264
[Door closes]

539
00:48:18,476 --> 00:48:20,728
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

540
00:48:20,855 --> 00:48:23,398
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

541
00:48:31,866 --> 00:48:33,742
[Ned] What news?

542
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:37,829
[Catelyn] She's fled the capital.

543
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,708
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

544
00:48:42,835 --> 00:48:44,710
By the Lannisters.

545
00:48:44,837 --> 00:48:47,505
She says the king is in danger.

546
00:48:47,632 --> 00:48:49,882
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

547
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:51,634
She doesn't know what she's saying.

548
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:57,056
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now
if the wrong people had found that letter.

549
00:48:57,183 --> 00:48:59,351
Do you think she would risk her life,

550
00:48:59,476 --> 00:49:01,061
her son's life,

551
00:49:01,186 --> 00:49:04,563
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

552
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,657
If this news is true...

553
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:17,326
and the Lannisters conspire
against the throne,

554
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:19,871
who but you can protect the king?

555
00:49:19,996 --> 00:49:22,248
They murdered the last Hand.

556
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,583
Now you want Ned to take the job?

557
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:28,587
The king rode for a month
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

558
00:49:28,713 --> 00:49:31,215
He's the only one he trusts.

559
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:35,552
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

560
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:39,264
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

561
00:49:39,391 --> 00:49:41,393
He owes him nothing.

562
00:49:43,311 --> 00:49:46,523
Your father and brother
rode south once

563
00:49:46,648 --> 00:49:49,275
on a king's demand.

564
00:49:51,195 --> 00:49:53,320
A different time.

565
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:56,782
A different king.

566
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:02,329
- [Noisy chatter]
- [Drumming]

567
00:50:23,601 --> 00:50:25,561
[Hissing]

568
00:50:30,775 --> 00:50:32,777
[Gasps]

569
00:50:57,969 --> 00:51:01,472
When do I meet with the khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

570
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,018
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,
you shall have it.

571
00:51:05,143 --> 00:51:08,188
- When?
- When their omens favor war.

572
00:51:09,315 --> 00:51:11,858
I piss on Dothraki omens.

573
00:51:11,983 --> 00:51:14,652
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.

574
00:51:23,996 --> 00:51:26,998
- [Crowd ululating]
- [Grunting]

575
00:51:41,514 --> 00:51:42,806
[Cheering]

576
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,400
[Speaks Dothraki] Iteo akkah
(?)

577
00:51:54,527 --> 00:51:55,985
[Blades clang]

578
00:52:05,538 --> 00:52:06,871
[Screams]

579
00:52:14,587 --> 00:52:19,550
A Dothraki wedding without at least
three deaths is considered a dull affair.

580
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:23,221
[Laughing]

581
00:52:32,273 --> 00:52:37,192
[Speaks Dothraki] {Jadi, zhey Jora Andahli.} - Come, Jorah the Andal
 - Great khal.

582
00:52:41,907 --> 00:52:44,951
A small gift, for the new khaleesi.

583
00:52:45,911 --> 00:52:48,496
Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

584
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:51,583
Thank you, ser.

585
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:55,962
Are you from my country?

586
00:52:56,087 --> 00:52:58,130
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

587
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:00,967
I served your father for many years.

588
00:53:01,092 --> 00:53:04,052
Gods be good, I hope to
always serve the rightful king.

589
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:29,954
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

590
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,831
from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

591
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:35,876
The ages have turned them to stone,

592
00:53:36,003 --> 00:53:37,962
but they will always be beautiful.

593
00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:41,882
Thank you, Magister.

594
00:54:50,576 --> 00:54:52,619
She's beautiful.

595
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:58,125
Ser Jorah, I...

596
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:01,003
I don't know how to say "thank you"
in Dothraki.

597
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,922
There is no word for "thank you"
in Dothraki.

598
00:55:25,112 --> 00:55:27,070
Make him happy.

599
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:41,251
[Waves crashing]

600
00:56:26,465 --> 00:56:28,465
- No.
- [Sobs]

601
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:33,637
Do you know the common tongue?

602
00:56:38,476 --> 00:56:40,186
- [Pin clanks]
- No.

603
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,650
Is "no" the only word that you know?

604
00:56:48,152 --> 00:56:49,487
No.

605
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,203
[Continues sobbing]

606
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:19,891
Rough night, Imp?

607
00:57:20,018 --> 00:57:21,978
If I get through this without squirting

608
00:57:22,103 --> 00:57:24,980
from one end or the other,
it'll be a miracle.

609
00:57:25,107 --> 00:57:26,898
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

610
00:57:27,025 --> 00:57:30,110
The greatest in the land -
my spear never misses.

611
00:57:31,195 --> 00:57:33,155
It's not hunting if you pay for it.

612
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:44,250
Are you as good with a spear
as you used to be?

613
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:46,835
No, but I'm still better than you.

614
00:57:46,962 --> 00:57:48,753
[Laughs]

615
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,465
I know what I'm putting you through.

616
00:57:51,592 --> 00:57:53,259
Thank you for saying yes.

617
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:57,679
I only ask you because I need you.

618
00:57:58,891 --> 00:58:01,433
You're a loyal friend. You hear me?

619
00:58:02,518 --> 00:58:04,103
A loyal friend.

620
00:58:04,228 --> 00:58:05,896
The last one I've got.

621
00:58:07,648 --> 00:58:09,817
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

622
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,322
And I'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

623
00:58:15,657 --> 00:58:17,909
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boar!

624
00:58:28,128 --> 00:58:29,628
Come on, you.

625
00:58:44,686 --> 00:58:46,020
[Whines]

626
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:56,529
[Grunts]

627
00:59:00,451 --> 00:59:02,286
[Barks softly]

628
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:10,460
[Woman gasping]

629
00:59:14,715 --> 00:59:16,342
[Woman moaning]

630
00:59:26,478 --> 00:59:28,145
[Grunting, moaning]

631
00:59:44,413 --> 00:59:45,871
[Gasps]

632
00:59:45,998 --> 00:59:48,791
- Stop! Stop.
- [Gasps]

633
00:59:53,672 --> 00:59:55,922
Are you completely mad?

634
00:59:56,049 --> 00:59:58,550
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

635
00:59:58,677 --> 01:00:00,719
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

636
01:00:00,846 --> 01:00:02,971
I heard you the first time.

637
01:00:04,181 --> 01:00:05,766
[Whimpers]

638
01:00:07,728 --> 01:00:09,395
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

639
01:00:10,688 --> 01:00:13,482
- How old are you, boy?
- Ten.

640
01:00:13,608 --> 01:00:15,192
Ten.

641
01:00:24,036 --> 01:00:26,369
- The things I do for love.
- [Gasps]

642
01:00:28,036 --> 01:00:32,369
OMG, DID THE KID DIE!??!?!

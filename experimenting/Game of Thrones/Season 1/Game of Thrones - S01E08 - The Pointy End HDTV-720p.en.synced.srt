19
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:41,129
你妹妹很清楚我们今天要走.
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.

20
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:43,331
- 她怎么会忘记... - 她没有忘记.
- How she could forget-- - She didn't forget.

21
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:46,067
她跟她的舞蹈老师在一起. 每天早上都是.
She's with her dancing master. She's with him every morning.

22
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:48,638
她总是带着满身瘀伤回来. 她真是笨手笨脚.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises. She's so clumsy.

23
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:50,573
<i>别出声!
- ( Swords clanging ) - Hush!</i>

24
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:52,808
回你的房间去.
Go back to your room.

25
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:55,146
插上门闩
Bar the doors

26
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,381
绝不要给不认识的人开门.
and do not open them for anyone you do not know.

27
00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:00,084
- 怎么了? 出什么事了? - 照我说的做.
- What is it? What's happening? - Do as I told you.

28
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:01,919
快跑!
Run!

29
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:07,324
<i>这边!
Man: This way!</i>

00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:10,828
<i>( Reaming )</i>

31
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:23,004
左, 右. 右!
Left, right. Rah!

32
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,740
现在你死了.
Now you are dead.

33
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:26,741
你说的是右边,
You said right,

34
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:28,644
但你打的却是左边.
but you went left.

35
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:30,878
结果你是个死女孩了.
And now you are a dead girl.

36
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:32,514
可是你骗人了.
Only 'cause you lied.

37
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,182
我的舌头骗人了. 可我的眼睛...
My tongue lied. My eyes

38
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:38,420
说的是真话. 只是你没看见.
shouted the truth. You were not seeing.

39
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:40,956
我明明看了, 但你...
I was so. I watched, but you--

40
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,460
看了不等于看见了, 死女孩.
watching is not seeing, dead girl.

41
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,165
只有看见, 只有真正的洞察,
The seeing, the true seeing,

42
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,635
才是剑术的精髓.
that is the heart of swordplay.

43
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,805
<i>( Door opens )</i>

44
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:59,644
艾莉亚史塔克, 跟我们走.
Arya Stark, come with us.

45
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:02,413
你父亲要见你.
Your father wants to see you.

46
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:04,816
可是为什么...
And why is it

47
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:07,284
艾德大人会派兰尼斯特家的人...
that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men

48
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:09,521
而不是他自己的手下来呢? 我很好奇.
in place of his own? I am wondering.

49
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:12,623
别不识好歹, 舞蹈老师.
Mind your place, dancing master.

50
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:15,193
<i>此事与你无关.
This is no concern of yours.</i>

51
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:17,062
我父亲才不会派你们来呢.
My father wouldn't send you.

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,300
而且我也不想跟你们走.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.

53
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:25,670
抓住她.
( Laughs ) Take her.

54
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:29,673
你们是人还是蛇, 居然威胁一个小孩子?
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?

55
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:31,843
给我滚开, 矮家伙.
Get out of my way, little man.

56
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:35,346
<i>我是西利欧佛瑞尔...
I am Syrio Forel...</i>

57
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,380
外国杂种.
Foreign bastard.

58
00:04:40,117 --> 00:04:43,821
...你跟我讲话要放尊重点.
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.

59
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:46,456
宰了这布拉佛斯人, 把那女孩抓来.
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

60
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:50,728
小艾莉亚, 今天我们的舞蹈课至此为止.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.

61
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:53,398
跑去找你父亲吧.
Run to your father.

62
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,622
该死的东西.
- Bloody oafs. - ( Sword rings )

63
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:18,524
快走, 艾莉亚.
Be gone now, Arya.

64
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:21,127
跟我一起走. 快跑.
Come with me. Run.

65
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:25,766
布拉佛斯的首席剑士从不临阵脱逃.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.

66
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:39,812
<i>记不记得我们应该
( Wood clatters )</i>

67
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:39,812
What do we say

68
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:41,781
怎么对死神说话?
to the God of death?

69
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:43,683
"今天不行."
Not today.

70
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:46,653
快走.
Go.

71
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:52,191
( Lannister men moaning )

72
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:59,463
<i>- ( Swords ringing ) - ( Men screaming )</i>

73
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:14,312
今天不行. 今天不行.
Not today. Not today.

74
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:19,718
( Gasps )

75
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:25,658
你不要过来.
Stay away from me.

76
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,358
我要告诉我父亲.
I'll tell my father.

77
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:30,362
我要... 我要告诉王后.
I'll-- I'll tell the Queen.

78
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:34,098
你以为是谁派我来的?
( Chuckles ) Who do you think sent me?

79
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:40,406
<i>( Horses neigh )</i>

80
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:48,480
缝衣针.
Needle.

81
00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:53,752
原来她在这儿.
There she is.

82
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:56,053
- 你想要什么? - 我要抓你, 小狼女.
- What do you want? - I want you, wolf girl.

83
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:57,790
- 过来. - 不要过来.
- Come here. - Leave me be.

84
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:59,891
我父亲是首相. 他会奖赏你的.
My father's a lord. He'll reward you.

85
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:01,492
<i>会奖赏我的是王后!
She'll reward me-- the Queen!</i>

86
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:03,694
走开!
- Stay away! - ( Gasps )

87
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:17,108
<i>( Door clanging, creaking )</i>

88
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:36,428
史塔克大人, 你一定渴了.
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.

89
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:40,033
瓦里斯.
Varys.

90
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,137
我向你保证里面没有下毒.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.

91
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:48,108
为什么没人肯信任太监呢?
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?

92
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:58,420
不太多, 大人.
Not so much, My Lord.

93
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:00,488
如果我是你的话, 我会留下一点.
I would save the rest, if I were you.

94
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:04,392
藏好它. 在这地牢里常有人被渴死.
Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.

95
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:08,764
我的女儿们怎么样了?
What about my daughters?

96
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:11,334
小的那个看来已经逃出了红堡.
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.

97
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:13,569
连我的小小鸟们都找不到她.
Even my little birds cannot find her.

98
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:17,139
- 珊莎呢? - 依然是乔佛里的未婚妻.
- And Sansa? - Still engaged to Joffrey.

99
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:20,744
瑟曦会把她留在身边. 但你家其他的人...
Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though--

100
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:22,946
全死了, 我感到很痛心.
all dead, it grieves me to say.

101
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,247
我讨厌看到流血.
I do so hate the sight of blood.

102
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,619
我的手下被屠杀时你却袖手旁观.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.

103
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:31,955
我只能那样, 大人.
And would again, My Lord.

104
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:36,392
我既没武器, 又没盔甲, 还被兰尼斯特的武士团团围住.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.

105
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:38,760
你看我象个大英雄吗?
When you look at me do you see a hero?

106
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:47,068
究竟是什么疯狂念头让你去告诉王后...
What madness led you to tell the Queen

107
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,905
说你知道乔佛里的真实身世?
you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?

108
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,243
仁慈的疯狂念头.
The madness of mercy.

109
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:58,681
希望她能保住她孩子们的性命.
That she might save her children.

110
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:00,548
<i>啊, 孩子们.
Ah, the children.</i>

111
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,452
受苦的总是那些无辜者.
It is always the innocents who suffer.

112
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:06,388
杀死国王的不是那袋酒, 也不是那只野猪.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.

113
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,892
酒令他反应迟缓, 野猪撕开了他的肚子,
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open,

114
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:13,160
但是真正杀死国王的却是你的仁慈.
but it was your mercy that killed the King.

115
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:20,100
我想你知道自己在劫难逃吧, 艾德大人?
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?

116
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:27,407
王后不会杀我.
The Queen can't kill me.

117
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,909
凯特还抓着她的弟弟.
Cat holds her brother.

118
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,645
可惜不是她爱的那个弟弟.
The wrong brother sadly.

119
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:34,414
而且这会儿也跑了.
And lost to her.

120
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,384
你夫人让小恶魔从她的指缝里钻了出去.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.

121
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:43,658
倘若真是这样,
If that's true,

122
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:47,227
那快快割了我的喉咙, 做个了结.
then slit my throat and be done with it.

123
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:49,831
今天不会, 大人.
Not today, My Lord.

124
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:55,703
告诉我, 瓦里斯.
Tell me something, Varys.

125
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:58,240
你究竟是为谁服务?
Who do you truly serve?

126
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:02,144
为了国家, 大人.
The Realm, My Lord.

127
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:04,447
总得有人为国家服务.
Someone must.

128
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:14,557
<i>( Door creaks, clangs )</i>

129
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:26,168
这是奥瑟, 肯定没错.
It's Othor, without a doubt.

130
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:29,104
另外那个是杰佛佛花, 大人,
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord,

131
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:31,907
<i>他的一只手被狼咬掉了.
less the hand the wolf tore off.</i>

132
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:34,943
有班扬或他手下其他人的踪迹吗?
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?

133
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:37,846
只有这两个, 大人.
Just these two, My Lord.

134
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:39,883
我看他们死了有一阵子了.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

135
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,653
- 嗯. - 可是气味...
- Mmm. - The smell.

136
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:46,024
( Sniffs )

137
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:47,658
怎么气味?
What smell?

138
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:50,729
没有气味.
There is none.

139
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:54,499
如果他们死了很久, 怎么还没腐烂?
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?

140
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,235
我们烧了他们吧.
We should burn them.

141
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:00,304
雪诺说得没错, 大人. 烧掉尸体吧.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord. Fire will do for them.

142
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:02,506
野人的处理方式.
The Wildling way.

143
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,277
我要先让伊蒙师傅检查一下这些尸体.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.

144
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:08,480
你也许是个懦夫, 塔利,
You may be a coward, Tarly,

145
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:10,649
<i>但人倒是不笨.
but you're not stupid.</i>

146
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:14,719
- 把他们弄进去. - 照他说的做.
- Get them inside. - You heard him.

147
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,222
总司令,
Lord Commander,

148
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:20,759
伊蒙师傅正在等你过去...
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers--

149
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:24,629
君临城来了一只渡鸦.
a raven from King's Landing.

150
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,530
快移出去.
Come on, move 'em out.

151
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:41,109
给我倒杯酒, 雪诺,
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

152
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:44,078
<i>再给你自己也倒一杯.
and pour one for yourself.</i>

153
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:56,457
国王死了.
The King is dead.

154
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,104
我父亲有什么消息?
Is there any word of my father?

155
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:13,373
坐下.
Sit.

156
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:20,412
史塔克大人...
Lord Stark has been

157
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:23,048
被控叛国.
charged with treason.

158
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:25,484
他们说他与劳勃的弟弟共谋
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers

159
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:28,254
阻止乔佛里王子继位.
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

160
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:44,240
<i>我希望你别打算做任何傻事.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.</i>

161
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:47,710
如今你的职责所在是这里.
Your duty lies here now.

162
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:50,812
我的妹妹也在君临.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.

163
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,250
我相信她们定会...
I'm sure they'll be

164
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:57,086
受到妥善照顾.
treated gently.

165
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:03,359
你的父亲犯下了严重的叛国罪.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.

166
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:06,863
劳勃国王尸骨未寒
King Robert's body was still warm

167
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:11,167
艾德大人就密谋夺取乔佛里的王位.
when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

168
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,570
他绝不会做这种事.
He wouldn't do that.

169
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:16,472
他知道我有多爱乔佛里. 他绝不会.
He knows how much I love Joffrey. He wouldn't.

170
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:19,610
求求您, 王后陛下, 这一定是误会.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.

171
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:23,280
找我父亲过来. 他会向您解释... 他是国王的朋友.
Send for my father. He'll tell you-- the King was his friend.

172
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:26,384
亲爱的珊莎, 你是完全无辜的. 我们都明白.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong. We know that.

173
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:29,919
<i>但你毕竟是个叛国者的女儿.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.</i>

174
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,121
我怎么敢让你嫁给我儿子呢?
How can I allow you to marry my son?

175
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:35,325
<i>叛国者的种必有背叛之性...
Pycelle: A child born of a traitor's seed</i>

176
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,692
不适合陪伴我们的国王.
is no fit consort for our King.

177
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:40,361
<i>眼下她是个可爱的好孩子, 陛下,
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,</i>

178
00:13:40,395 --> 00:13:42,864
可十年以后谁知道...
but in 10 years who knows

179
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:44,865
她会否同样犯下背叛罪行呢?
what treasons she may hatch?

180
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,969
不, 我不是. 我一定会成为他的好妻子.
No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.

181
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:52,573
我会成为象您一样的好王后, 我保证. 我绝不会做任何错事.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise. I won't hatch anything.

182
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:56,577
这孩子是无辜的, 陛下.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

183
00:13:56,613 --> 00:14:00,414
应该给她一个机会, 来证明她的忠诚.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.

184
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,688
( Huffs )

185
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,625
可爱的小鸽子, 你得写信给凯特琳夫人
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn

186
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:11,994
以及你的大哥, 他叫什么名字?
and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?

187
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:13,763
罗柏.
Robb.

188
00:14:13,797 --> 00:14:16,566
你父亲被捕的消息很快就会传到他那里.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.

189
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,001
所以最好由你来告诉他.
Best it comes from you.

190
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:21,404
如果你想救你父亲,
If you would help your father,

191
00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:23,875
就必须敦促你大哥维护王国的和平.
urge your brother to keep the King's peace.

192
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:27,812
叫他前来君临向乔佛里宣誓效忠.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

193
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:37,453
或许... 如果我可以见见我父亲, 和他谈谈...
If-- if I could see my father, talk to him about--

194
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:43,426
你太令我失望了, 孩子.
You disappoint me, child.

195
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,760
我们已经告诉过你令尊的罪行.
We have told you of your father's treason.

196
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,962
为何你还想要见一个叛徒?
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?

197
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:50,264
我只是想知道...
I only meant that--

198
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:54,302
他会被如何处置?
what will happen to him?

199
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:59,706
- 这要看情况. - 看什么... 情况?
- That depends. - On-- on what?

200
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,609
看你的大哥...
On your brother.

201
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:06,980
还有你会如何做.
And on you.

202
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:17,493
叛国?
Treason?

203
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:19,662
这信是珊莎写的?
Sansa wrote this?

204
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:22,065
是你妹妹的笔迹, 但其实是王后的言辞.
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.

205
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:26,201
召你去君临向新王宣誓效忠.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.

206
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:29,338
乔佛里囚禁了我父亲, 还想要我对他效忠?
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?

207
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:32,875
这是王室的谕令, 大人.
This is a royal command, My Lord.

208
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:36,379
- 如果你拒绝服从... - 我不会拒绝.
- If you should refuse to obey-- - I won't refuse.

209
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:39,182
既然国王陛下召我去君临,
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,

210
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:41,650
那我会去君临的.
I'll go to King's Landing.

211
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:44,419
但不是一个人去.
But not alone.

212
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:48,256
立刻召集封臣.
Call the banners.

213
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,625
召集全部吗, 大人?
All of them, My Lord?

214
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,532
他们全都发过誓要保卫我父亲, 是吧?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?

215
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:54,756
是的.
They have.

216
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,932
现在就让我们看看他们能否信守誓言吧.
Now we see what their words are worth.

217
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,202
好吧.
Yeah.

218
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,846
你感到害怕吗?
Are you afraid?

219
00:16:14,684 --> 00:16:16,384
我是感到害怕.
I must be.

220
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,587
很好.
Good.

221
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,655
为什么这很好?
Why is that good?

222
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:22,991
这说明你并不愚蠢.
It means you're not stupid.

223
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:28,129
( Cawing )

224
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:48,283
你在清早就收到这封信了?
You've had this since dawn?

225
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:51,886
信是发给我的, 而不是给你的.
He sent it to me, not you.

226
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,355
我只是出于礼貌才给你看.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.

227
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,258
出于礼貌?!
A courtesy?!

228
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,293
我的丈夫被囚禁.
My husband has been taken prisoner.

229
00:16:58,327 --> 00:16:59,961
我的儿子准备宣战.
My son intends to declare war.

230
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,864
宣战?
A war?

231
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,299
你儿子要对兰尼斯特家开战?
Your son against the Lannisters?

232
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:08,703
你应该赶去他那里. 叫他保持耐心.
You should go to him. Teach him patience.

233
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:11,906
奈德在地牢里等死, 你还说要保持耐心?
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?

234
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:14,644
他是你的姐夫!
He is your brother by law!

235
00:17:14,678 --> 00:17:17,547
难道家族对你来说毫无意义吗?
Does family mean nothing to you?

236
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,450
家族对我来说意味着一切.
Family means everything to me.

237
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:22,919
我绝不会拿罗宾的性命来冒险
And I will not risk Robin's life

238
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:25,422
卷入另一场跟你丈夫有关的战争.
to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.

239
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:28,357
- 我饿了. - 安静, 亲爱的.
- I'm hungry. - Hush now, darling.

240
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,593
你刚刚吃过呀.
You just ate.

241
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:33,462
那你不会支持我们了? 你是这个意思吗?
You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?

242
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:37,333
- 可我就是饿了! - 快了, 亲爱的, 快了.
- But I'm hungry! - Soon, love, soon.

243
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:41,671
这儿永远欢迎你, 姐姐.
You're always welcome here, sister.

244
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:44,707
但如果你想要我派兵离开艾林谷去参战...
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight--

245
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:46,942
我就是想要你这样做.
That is what I ask.

246
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:51,780
亲爱的. 你该洗澡了.
Go on, sweet. Time for your bath.

247
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:54,416
洗过澡我就喂你吃.
I'll feed you after.

248
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,092
如果你担心你儿子的安危...
If you fear for the safety of your son--

249
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,794
我当然担心我儿子的安危!
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!

250
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:07,329
你当我是白痴吗?
Are you an idiot?

251
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:09,766
他们谋杀了我丈夫.
They killed my husband.

252
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,234
<i>你说他们还把你儿子从窗口抛下去.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.</i>

253
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:14,804
那些人什么都干得出来.
These people will do anything.

254
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:16,904
所以我们必须阻止他们.
And that is why we have to stop them.

255
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,478
谷地的骑士将留在谷地
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale

256
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:27,248
他们属于这里, 他们得保护他们的领主.
where they belong, to protect their Lord.

257
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:35,691
( Whistling a tune )

258
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:44,067
你能不能闭嘴?
Will you shut up?

259
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,204
这一带到处是山地部落.
There's hill tribes all around here.

260
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,708
如果我真的要死了,
If I'm going to die,

261
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:53,076
我宁愿哼着歌去死.
it may as well be with a song in my heart.

262
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:56,347
我可以抢走你的食物并把你丢在这里.
I should just take your food and leave you here.

263
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:59,651
嗯? 那时候你会怎样?
Eh? What would you do then?

264
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:02,520
八成会被饿死.
Starve, most likely.

265
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,388
你觉得我不会这么做, 是吗?
You don't think I'd do it, do you?

266
00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:08,926
你想要什么, 波隆? 金子? 女人?
What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women?

267
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,864
多金的女人?
Golden women?

268
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:14,099
跟着我, 你要什么有什么,
Stick with me and you'll have them all,

269
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:16,968
只要有我在, 你很快就能得到你想要的.
for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.

270
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,270
你知道这一点.
But you knew that.

271
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:23,874
所以你才会如此勇敢地为维护我的荣誉而出战.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.

272
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:28,078
很公平.
Fair enough.

273
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:30,648
但别指望我会对你卑躬屈膝...
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee

274
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:33,251
对你说话时满口老爷大人.
and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.

275
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:36,555
我不当你的仆人, 也不当你的朋友.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.

276
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:39,792
但我珍视你的友谊,
Though I would treasure your friendship,

277
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:42,429
我主要看重你杀人的身手.
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.

278
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,866
而要是哪天真有人引诱你出卖我,
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out,

279
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,634
请你记住:
remember this:

280
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,538
不管他们出价多少, 我都能出更多给你.
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.

281
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:52,673
我很爱惜我这条命.
I like living.

282
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:55,209
( Whistles )

283
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:01,115
<i>提利昂.
- ( Rustling ) - ( Bronn whispers ) Tyrion.</i>

284
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:03,951
提利昂.
Tyrion.

285
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,990
提利昂.
Tyrion.

286
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:12,160
<i>( Birds chirp, flutter )</i>

287
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,383
过来一起烤烤火吧.
Come, share our fire.

288
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,184
再尝尝我们的山羊肉.
Help yourselves to our goat.

289
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,460
当你去见你的神的时候, 告诉他们
When you meet your Gods, you tell them

290
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,429
是石鸦部落的多夫之子夏嘎...
Shagga Son of Dolf

291
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:51,832
送你上路的.

292
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:55,269
我是兰尼斯特部落的泰温之子提利昂.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.

293
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:58,338
你想要怎么个死法, 泰温之子提利昂?
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?

294
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,509
我想活到八十岁死在自己的床上
In my own bed, at the age of 80

295
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:05,412
喝饱一肚子酒, 还有个姑娘在下面给我吹萧.
with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.

296

( All laughing )

298
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,820
把那半人抓起来.
Take the half man.

299
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,623
可以让他给孩子们跳舞. 把另外那家伙宰了.
He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.

300
00:21:16,657 --> 00:21:18,759
不不不不不!
No no no no no!

301
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:21,862
我的家族既有钱又有势.
My-- my House is rich and powerful.

302
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:24,564
只要你们保我们平安出山,
If you see us through these mountains,

303
00:21:24,598 --> 00:21:26,567
我父亲赏你们的金子会多到可以拿来洗澡.
my father will shower you with gold.

304
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:28,635
我们才不相信半人的承诺.
We have no use for a half man's promises.

305
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,240
我虽然只是半个人, 但至少我有勇气面前敌人.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.

306
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:34,875
石鸦部落的人呢?
What do the Stone Crows do?

307
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,144
还不是只敢躲在石头后面发抖
Hide behind rocks and shiver

308
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:40,147
当谷地的骑士经过的时候?
when the knights of the Vale ride by?

309
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:42,817
你们就只偷得到这种货色?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?

310
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,054
杀羊或许可以,
Good enough for killing sheep,

311
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,822
还得那羊乖乖认命让你们杀.
if the sheep don't fight back.

312
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:50,057
兰尼斯特家的铁匠拉出的屎都比这高级.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

313
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,133
你以为你能用你的小零碎换你的命?
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?

314
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:13,414
这小零碎比你们部落的所有东西都更值钱.
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.

315
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:18,689
如果你肯帮我们, 多夫之子夏嘎,
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,

316
00:22:18,722 --> 00:22:21,392
我不止会给你小零碎.
I will not give you trinkets.

317
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,894
我会给你这个.
I will give you this.

318
00:22:24,797 --> 00:22:26,397
什么 "这个"?
What is "this"?

319
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,101
整个艾林谷.
The Vale of Arryn.

320
00:22:30,135 --> 00:22:33,438
艾林谷的领主们一直在欺压山地部落.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.

321
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:37,675
艾林谷的领主们想要我死.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.

322
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:42,480
我想是时候让谷地换一批新领主了.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.

323
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:52,221
<i>真是难得一见的人物...
Ser Alliser: Now there's a rare sight--</i>

324
00:22:52,257 --> 00:22:55,759
不但是个野种, 还是个叛国者的野种呢.
not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.

325
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:09,506
- 琼恩, 不要! - 琼恩, 住手, 把刀放下!
- Jon, no! - Jon, stop, put it down!

326
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:14,844
血统决定善恶.
Blood will always tell.

327
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:18,015
你会被吊死的, 野种.
You'll hang for this, bastard.

328
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,535
我告诉过你别做傻事.
I told you not to do anything stupid.

329
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:44,204
你被关禁闭了. 去吧.
You're confined to quarters. Go.

白灵, 怎么了?
Ghost, what's wrong?

332

我以为多斯拉克人不信赖金钱.
Daenerys: I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.

358
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:57,905

- 卡丽熙? - 你听到我的命令了.
- Khaleesi? - You heard me.

363

These men have shed blood for their Khal. Now they claim their rewards.

欢迎你这么做, 安伯大人.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.

455
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,839
等我收拾完兰尼斯特家
And when I am done with the Lannisters

456
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:15,174
我会立刻回师北上,
I will march back North,

457
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,676
把你从你的城堡里抓出来
root you out of your Keep

458
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:19,381
并当成背誓者吊死.
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

459
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,415
背誓者, 是吗?!
Oathbreaker, is it?!

460
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:25,554
我可不会干坐着任人侮辱
I'll not sit here and swallow insults

461
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,123
特别是象你这种刚从泥里钻出来的小鬼, 八成连尿都还有青草气.
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

462
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:30,959
( Snarls )

463
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,694
<i>( Screaming )</i>

464
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:44,605
我父亲曾教导我必须以死刑惩戒...
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel

465
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:46,707
<i>敢对主君拔剑的封臣.
- against your Liege Lord. - ( Huffs )</i>

466
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,045
但我相信大琼恩只是想帮我切肉罢了.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.

467
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:55,517
你的肉...
Your meat...

468
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:03,326
还真他妈的硬.
is bloody tough.

469
00:34:04,228 --> 00:34:06,395
<i>( Chortles )</i>

470
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,467
( All laughing )

471
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,929
- 怎么了? 出什么事了? - 嘘, 没什么.
- What is it? What's happened? - Shh, it's all right.

472
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:44,971
- 你要去哪儿? - 去南方. 去救父亲.
- Where are you going? - South. For father.

473
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:46,706
可现在是午夜啊.
But it's the middle of the night.

474
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,875
兰尼斯特家的探子无处不在.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

475
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,476
我不希望让他们知道我们已经出发.
I don't want them to know we're coming.

476
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:54,213
他们的人马比我们多.
They have more men than we do.

477
00:34:54,248 --> 00:34:56,449
嗯, 是这样的.
Aye, they do.

478
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:58,550
我能和你一起去吗?
Can't I come with you?

479
00:34:58,585 --> 00:35:01,086
现在我能骑马了. 你看过我骑马了.
I can ride now. You've seen me riding.

480
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:03,222
我不会再惹麻烦的, 我...
And I won't get in the way, I--

481
00:35:03,257 --> 00:35:05,791
临冬城必须有史塔克家的人坐镇.
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.

482
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:07,960
在我回来之前你就是城主.
Until I return that will be you.

483
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:13,699
我们走后你绝不能离开城堡. 明白吗?
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone. Do you understand?

484
00:35:16,338 --> 00:35:19,706
好好听从鲁温师傅的教导. 好好照顾你的弟弟.
Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.

485
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,876
我会的.
I will.

486
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,978
我有时间就会写信回来,
I'll send letters whenever I can,

487
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:26,248
但如果你很久没收到我的信,
but if you don't hear from me,

488
00:35:26,282 --> 00:35:28,184
也不要担心.
don't be scared.

489
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:35,492
我会回来的.
Until I return.

490
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:58,782
你躲在那儿多久了?
How long have you been hiding out there?

491
00:35:58,818 --> 00:36:02,286
罗柏会找你道别.
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.

492
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:05,556
他们全都走了.
They've all gone away.

493
00:36:05,592 --> 00:36:08,527
他们很快就会回来. 罗柏会救出父亲
They'll be back soon. Robb will free father

494
00:36:08,561 --> 00:36:10,762
他们会和母亲一道回来.
and they'll come back with mother.

495
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,934
不, 他们不会.
No, they won't.

496
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:21,708
<i>请你们务必看顾罗柏.
Bran: Please watch over Robb.</i>

497
00:36:21,742 --> 00:36:24,210
也请你们看顾临冬城所所有人马.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.

498
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:27,413
还有, 还有席恩.
And Theon too, I suppose.

499
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,887
你听见了吗, 孩子?
You hear them, boy?

500
00:36:35,922 --> 00:36:38,523
旧神正在回答你.
The Old Gods are answering you.

501
00:36:38,557 --> 00:36:40,458
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

502
00:36:40,492 --> 00:36:43,362
他们也是我的神.
They're my Gods too.

503
00:36:44,864 --> 00:36:48,467
在长城之外, 他们是惟一的真神.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.

504
00:36:49,836 --> 00:36:52,139
即便奴隶也可以祈祷.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.

505
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:54,541
你可不是奴隶.
You're not a slave.

506
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,579
嗯, 你的朋友确实曾经拿刀抵住我的喉咙.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.

507
00:37:00,715 --> 00:37:03,317
我不是在抱怨, 小领主,
I'm not complaining, Little Lord,

508
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:06,085
只是说出事实.
just telling truths.

509
00:37:07,387 --> 00:37:10,190
你说听见神说话是什么意思?
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?

510
00:37:10,224 --> 00:37:12,559
你向他们祈求,
You asked them,

511
00:37:12,592 --> 00:37:14,226
而他们正在回答.
they're answering you.

512
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:17,231
嘘.
Shh.

513
00:37:17,264 --> 00:37:18,931
竖起耳朵.
Open your ears.

514
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:21,367
<i>( Leaves rustling )</i>

515
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:26,606
不过是风声.
It's only the wind.

516
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:29,643
你以为这风是谁送来的?
Who do you think sends the wind

517
00:37:29,677 --> 00:37:31,644
如果不是诸神的话?
if not the Gods?

518
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,380
他们能看到你, 孩子.
They see you, boy.

519
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:35,817
<i>他们也能听到你说话.
They hear you.</i>

520
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:37,418
<i>( Sighs )</i>

521
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:40,289
在你哥哥要去的地方, 他们无法帮他.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.

522
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:43,125
旧神在南方没有力量.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.

523
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:46,829
那儿的鱼梁木早已被砍伐一空.
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.

524
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,632
没有眼睛, 他们如何看顾你哥哥呢?
How can they watch when they have no eyes?

525
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,067
<i>( Running footsteps )</i>

526
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,539
嗯, 真是个大块头.
( Osha giggles ) Well, there's a big man.

527
00:37:56,572 --> 00:37:59,742
我敢说他有巨人的血统.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.

528
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:02,143
回去找你的衣服, 阿多.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.

529
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:04,012
<i>去穿衣服吧.
- ( Laughs ) - Go dress.</i>

530
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:05,579
阿多.
Hodor.

531
00:38:08,717 --> 00:38:10,918
长城之外真的有巨人吗?
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?

532
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:15,257
有巨人, 还有比巨人更可怕的生物.
Giants and worse than giants.

533
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:18,260
我跟你哥哥说过,
I tried telling your brother,

534
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:20,094
他走错方向了.
he's marching the wrong way.

535
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:23,632
所有的人马, 他们应该去北方, 孩子.
All these swords, they should be going North, boy.

536
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:25,833
北方, 不是南方!
North, not south!

537
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,972
寒风已然吹起.
The cold winds are rising.

538
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:32,507
<i>( Leaves rustling )</i>

539
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,293
他们被异鬼做了手脚.
They were touched by White Walkers.

540
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,797
所以他们才会回来.
That's why they came back.

541
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,699
所以他们的眼睛才会变成蓝色.
That's why their eyes turned blue.

542
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,869
只有火能阻止他们.
Only fire will stop them.

543
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,572
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

544
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,342
我从书上看到的...
I read about it in a book--

545
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:07,445
伊蒙师傅的图书馆里的一本非常古老的书.
a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.

546
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,115
那本书还说了些什么?
What else did the book say?

547
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,050
异鬼
The White Walkers

548
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,853
在冰层之下沉睡了数千年.
sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.

549
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,423
当他们苏醒的时候...
And when they wake up--

550
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:24,262
当他们苏醒的时候会怎样?
And when they wake up, what?

551
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,733
我希望长城足够高.
I hope The Wall is high enough.

552
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,757
( Men chattering )

553
00:40:02,264 --> 00:40:04,565
是夏雪, 夫人.
Summer snows, My Lady.

554
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:07,635
罗柏马带来了北境的人马.
Robb's brought the North with him.

555
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,710
河间地的领主们正在败退
The River Lords are falling back

556
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,579
詹姆兰尼斯特在后面穷追不舍.
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

557
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:21,016
而泰温大人正带着另一支兰尼斯特军队从南方进逼.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.

558
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,820
我们的斥候报告说其规模比弑君者的更庞大.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.

559
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:27,125
管他一支还是两支军队, 北境之王...
One army or two, the Kings in the North

560
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:30,961
能够打垮十倍优势的敌人.
threw back hosts 10 times as large.

561
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,132
母亲!
Mother!

562
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,771
你气色很好.
You look well.

563
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:47,043
凯特琳夫人, 在此动乱时刻见到您真是高兴.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.

564
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,545
我们没想到会在这里见到您, 夫人.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.

565
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,083
我也没想到会来这里.
I had not thought to be here.

566
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,184
我想单独和我儿子讲几句话.
I would speak with my son alone.

567
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,521
相信诸位大人能够理解.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.

568
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,789
你们听见夫人说的话了! 快动身!
You heard her! Move your asses!

569
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,159
快点, 到外面去.
Come on, out.

570
00:41:02,195 --> 00:41:04,829
你也是, 葛雷乔伊. 你他妈的耳聋了吗?
You too, Greyjoy. Are you bloody deaf?

571
00:41:04,864 --> 00:41:06,766
不要担心, 夫人.
Have no fear, My Lady.

572
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,568
<i>我们会拿剑拥穿泰温兰尼斯特的屁眼...
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole</i>

573
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:12,371
然后打下红堡救出奈德.
and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.

574
00:41:12,405 --> 00:41:15,338
- 你这老鬼头, 罗德利克. - 大琼恩.
- You old devil, Rodrik. - Jon.

575
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,708
你的功夫还没荒废, 是吗?
You're not wasting away, are you?

576
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:31,788
我还清楚地记得你出生那天的样子...
I remember the day you came into this world

577
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,858
脸红红的, 大声哭闹.
red-faced and squalling.

578
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,028
现在我却看到你率领着一支大军上战场.
And now I find you leading a host to war.

579
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:42,465
- 没别人了. - 没别人?
- There was no one else. - No one?

580
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,235
我刚才见到的那些人是谁?
Who were those men I saw here?

581
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:48,338
- 他们都不是史塔克. - 他们都身经百战.
- None of them are Starks. - All of them are seasoned in battle.

582
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:51,409
如果你想把我送回临冬城...
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell--

583
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:53,710
哦, 我真希望能这么做.
Oh, would that I could.

584
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:58,750
我收到了...
There was...

585
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:01,219
一封信.
a letter.

586
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,090
珊莎写来的.
From Sansa.

587
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:08,360
你的意思是王后写来的.
From the Queen, you mean.

588
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:19,436
- 上面没有提到艾莉亚. - 确实没有.
- There's no mention of Arya. - No.

589
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,380
你带来多少人?
How many men do you have?

590
00:42:32,414 --> 00:42:34,817
一万八千.
18,000.

591
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,318
如果我去君临向乔佛里屈膝下跪...
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey--

592
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:40,422
不, 那样你将永远无法离开.
you would never be allowed to leave. No.

593
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:43,224
我们最大的希望... 或者说惟一的希望...
Our best hope-- our only hope--

594
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:46,561
便是你能在战场上击败对手.
is that you can defeat them in the field.

595
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:48,630
如果我战败?
And if I lose?

596
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:51,199
你知道坦格利安家孩子们的下场吗...
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children

597
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:54,237
- 当君临城陷的时候? - 他们在睡梦中被屠杀.
- when the Mad King fell? - They were butchered in their sleep.

598
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,972
是泰温兰尼斯特下的命令.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

599
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,710
多年的时光并没有使他变仁慈一点.
And the years have not made him kinder.

600
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,983
如果你战败,
If you lose,

601
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:07,719
你的父亲会死,
your father dies,

602
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:09,286
你的妹妹们也会死,
your sisters die,

603
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,554
<i>我们都会死.
we die.</i>

604
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,159
好吧, 那事情就简单了.
Well, that makes it simple then.

605
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,494
我想是这样.
I suppose it does.

606
00:43:42,516 --> 00:43:45,751
现在最好由波隆和我两个过去.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.

607
00:43:45,786 --> 00:43:48,356
对泰温之子提利昂来说最好.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.

608
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:50,391
对我们来说可不好.
Not best for me.

609
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:53,594
如果半人背叛我们,
If the half man betrays us,

610
00:43:53,628 --> 00:43:57,065
多夫之子夏嘎就会剁掉他的命根子...
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood--

611
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:59,635
拿去喂山羊, 我知道.
and feed it to the goats, yes.

612
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,706
那好吧.
All right then.

613
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,943
我要去见我父亲了.
Time to meet my father.

614
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:42,077
- 提利昂. - 叔叔.
- Tyrion. - Uncle.

615
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,980
父亲.
Father.

616
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:48,483
看来关于你已死的传言不攻自破了.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.

617
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:51,920
真抱歉让您失望了.
Sorry to disappoint you.

618
00:44:51,954 --> 00:44:54,489
这些是什么人...
And who are these...

619
00:44:54,523 --> 00:44:56,757
<i>你的同伴?
Companions of yours?</i>

620
00:44:58,827 --> 00:45:01,260
这位是多夫之子夏嘎,
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,

621
00:45:01,295 --> 00:45:03,664
<i>石鸦部的酋长.
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.</i>

622
00:45:03,697 --> 00:45:08,068
<i>提魅之子提魅, 灼人部的首领.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.</i>

623
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:12,840
<i>这位美少女是齐克之女齐拉
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk,</i>

624
00:45:12,873 --> 00:45:15,242
<i>黑耳部的领袖.
leader of the Black Ears.</i>

625
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:18,646
而这位是波隆, 谁人之子来着...
And here we have Bronn son of...

626
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:21,282
你不会认识他的.
You wouldn't know him.

627
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:25,855
可否允许我为各位介绍我的父亲大人,
May I present My Lord Father,

628
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,523
兰尼斯特家族的泰陀斯之子泰温,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,

629
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,626
<i>凯岩城主暨西境守护.
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?</i>

630
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,233
非常感谢您为我出兵打仗.
Kind of you to go to war for me.

631
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,204
你使我们别无选择.
You left us no choice.

632
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,306
这事关家族的荣誉.
The honor of the House was at stake.

633
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:47,978
你哥哥詹姆绝不会如此轻易地束手就擒的.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.

634
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,547
我们确实有所不同, 詹姆和我.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.

635
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,750
他更勇敢. 而我更帅气.
He's braver. I'm better looking.

636
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:55,119
他满身都是荣耀.
He's been covering himself in glory.

637
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:58,389
詹姆在金牙城外击溃了三河诸侯,
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth,

638
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:02,092
现在正在围攻奔流城, 凯特琳史塔克的老家.
and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.

639
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,228
史塔克家在做什么? 艾德大人?
And the Starks? Lord Eddard?

640
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:08,331
--现在是我们的人质. 他在地牢里无法带兵打仗.
--Is our hostage. He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.

641
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:10,400
我那美丽的姐姐是怎么说服国王
How did my sweet sister persuade the King

642
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,302
囚禁他亲爱的朋友奈德的?
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

643
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:16,307
劳勃拜拉席恩死了. 如今是乔佛里在君临执政.
Robert Baratheon is dead. Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

644
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:21,280
你的意思是说是我姐姐在执政.
My sister rules, you mean.

645
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:24,784
史塔克的儿子已经下令召集封臣.
Stark's son has called his banners.

646
00:46:24,818 --> 00:46:28,255
- 他正带着一支大军南下. - 不过是个毛头小子.
- He moves south with a strong host. - A green boy.

647
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:30,056
等他尝到战斗的滋味就会...
One taste of battle and he'll run

648
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,659
夹着尾巴逃回临冬城.
back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.

649
00:46:33,862 --> 00:46:35,362
也许吧.
Maybe.

650
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:37,965
不过那小子确实很好战.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.

651
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:40,501
你会喜欢他的.
You'd like him.

652
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:44,572
既然我们说到打仗的事情,
While we're on the subject of war,

653
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:47,307
我对这几位朋友做过承诺
I made promises to my friends here

654
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:49,710
而兰尼斯特有债必还.
and a Lannister always pays his debts.

655
00:46:49,744 --> 00:46:52,813
<i>我们需要三千个头盔和盾牌,
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields,</i>

656
00:46:52,847 --> 00:46:55,081
还有刀剑, 长枪,
plus swords, pikes,

657
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:56,916
护甲, 钉锤...
gorgets, maces--

658
00:46:56,951 --> 00:46:59,518
如果大人同意,
if it please My Lord,

659
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:01,621
亚当爵士要我来报告, 北境军队
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen

660
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:03,054
已经越过了颈泽.
have crossed the neck.

661
00:47:05,057 --> 00:47:07,525
小狼就要钻进狮口了.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.

662
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:11,797
好吧. 凯冯, 立刻下令敲鼓集合.
So be it. Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.

663
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,436
并送信给詹姆说我将前去同罗柏史塔克决战.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.

664
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:18,438
遵命, 大人.
At once, My Lord.

665
00:47:31,387 --> 00:47:34,355
听说山地部落的人都是伟大的战士.
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.

666
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:36,123
与我一同出兵作战
Ride with me against my enemies

667
00:47:36,157 --> 00:47:39,193
你们将得到我儿子承诺的一切, 甚至更多.
and you shall have all my son promised you and more.

668
00:47:39,228 --> 00:47:41,463
但这个半人得跟我们一起作战.
Only if the half man fights with us.

669
00:47:41,498 --> 00:47:44,934
直到我们拿到他答应的武器,
Until we hold the steel he pledged us,

670
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:47,369
这小狮子的命是我们的.
the little lion's life is ours.

671
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:55,612
<i>斥候报告说泰温大人正在北上.
Rodrik: The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.</i>

672
00:47:55,646 --> 00:47:57,480
我们需要凭借险要地形截住他,
We need to get him on broken ground,

673
00:47:57,514 --> 00:47:59,181
使他的骑士无法发挥力量.
put his Knights at a disadvantage.

674
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:01,318
不, 我们要从他侧面绕过去
No, we need to get around him

675
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:04,253
并打破詹姆兰尼斯特对奔流城的围攻.
and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

676
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:07,123
这样三河诸候就会加入我们的队伍.
Do that and the River Lords will join us.

677
00:48:07,157 --> 00:48:09,025
无论怎样做我们都需要先过绿叉河
To do either we need to cross the river

678
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:10,726
而孪河城是过河的惟一路线.
and the only crossing is at The Twins.

679
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,795
<i>佛雷大人控制着孪河桥.
Theon: Lord Frey controls that bridge.</i>

680
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:14,396
他是你父亲的封臣.
Your father's bannerman.

681
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:17,666
我父亲称他为 "迟到的佛雷大人"
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.

682
00:48:17,701 --> 00:48:21,204
当年三叉戟河之战, 他在战斗结束后才现身.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.

683
00:48:21,237 --> 00:48:25,275
不是每个人都把自己的誓言当回事的.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.

684
00:48:27,244 --> 00:48:29,778
( Grunting )

685
00:48:32,682 --> 00:48:35,418
罗柏说得对. 我们需要那座桥.
Robb's right. We need that bridge.

686
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:37,552
那么该怎么办?
So what's it going to be?

687
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:40,989
我们先对付詹姆还是泰温?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?

688
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:46,695
打扰了, 大人.
Your pardon, my lords.

689
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:49,398
<i>我们抓住了一个兰尼斯特军的斥候.
We've captured a Lannister scout.</i>

690
00:48:51,302 --> 00:48:54,637
别担心, 小伙子. 他不会活着离开这个帐篷.
Don't worry, lad. He won't b  leaving this tent with his head.

691
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,641
你们在哪儿发现他的?
Where did you find him?

692
00:48:57,675 --> 00:48:59,809
在营地周围的树丛里.
In the brush above the encampment.

693
00:48:59,844 --> 00:49:01,711
<i>他好象正在估算人数.
He looked to be counting.</i>

694
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,958
你算出来有多少人?
How high did you get?

695
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:18,329
两万. 或许更多.
20,000. Maybe more.

696
00:49:19,364 --> 00:49:21,097
你不必自己动手行刑.
You don't have to do this yourself.

697
00:49:21,132 --> 00:49:22,699
您父亲会理解的...
Your father would understand--

698
00:49:22,733 --> 00:49:26,769
我父亲懂得仁慈, 如果不是非杀不可.
My father unrstands mercy, when there is room for it.

699
00:49:28,172 --> 00:49:30,005
他也懂得荣誉...
And he understands honor...

700
00:49:32,811 --> 00:49:35,077
和勇气.
and courage.

701
00:49:36,981 --> 00:49:38,815
放他走吧.
Let him go.

702
00:49:39,784 --> 00:49:42,184
罗柏.
Robb.

703
00:49:54,197 --> 00:49:57,164
去告诉泰温大人, 凛冬将至.
( Softly ) Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.

704
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:02,135
两万北境大军正在南下, 看看他是不是真的能拉金屎.
20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.

705
00:50:04,206 --> 00:50:05,706
遵命, 大人.
Yes, My Lord.

706
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:07,541
多谢, 大人.
Thank you, My Lord.

707
00:50:16,985 --> 00:50:20,688
你疯了吗, 孩子?! 放他走?
Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?

708
00:50:20,722 --> 00:50:22,757
你又称我孩子了.
You call me boy again.

709
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,893
下去吧.
Go on.

710
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,302
( Growls )

711
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:46,112
喂.
Oi.

712
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:53,853
<i>国王陛下决定...
Pycelle: It is also the wish of His Grace</i>

713
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:59,193
<i>尽忠职守的杰诺斯史林特,

00:50:59,226 --> 00:51:02,329
<i>- 都城守卫队司令... - 艾伦爵士.

715
00:51:02,364 --> 00:51:05,934
<i>立刻擢升为贵族...
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...</i>

716
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:11,438
<i>- 盖尔斯大人. - ...赐予古老的赫伦堡,
- Lord Gyles. - ...And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal,</i>

717
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:15,309
<i>其子嗣将世代继承此等荣耀
and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor</i>

718
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:20,447
<i>直到世界末日.
after him until the end of time.</i>

719
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:22,981
( Lords mutter )

720
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:27,619
为取代叛徒艾德史塔克,
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,

721
00:51:27,653 --> 00:51:32,324
<i>国王陛下决定由泰温兰尼斯特,
it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister,</i>

722
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:36,161
<i>凯岩城主暨西境守护,

723
00:51:36,195 --> 00:51:40,298
<i>担任国王之手.
be appointed Hand of the King.</i>

724
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:42,233
最后,
Lastly,

725
00:51:42,268 --> 00:51:45,103
于此密谋四起, 动乱不堪之际,
in these times of treason and turmoil,

00:51:45,137 --> 00:51:48,373
<i>御前会议认为...
it is the view of the Council</i>

727
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:53,644
乔佛里国王的生命安全
that the life and safety

728
00:51:50,976 --> 00:51:53,644
of King Joffrey

729
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,916
实乃第一要务.
be of paramount importance.

730
00:51:59,518 --> 00:52:02,052
巴利斯坦赛尔弥爵士.
Ser Barristan Selmy.

731
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:11,896
陛下, 我听候您的差遣.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.

732
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:14,032
请起, 巴利斯坦爵士.
Rise, Ser Barristan.

733
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:17,003
你可以卸下头盔了.
You may remove your helm.

734
00:52:21,943 --> 00:52:24,545
<i>长久以来你为国效命，尽忠职守.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.</i>

735
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:28,550
<i>七国上下每个人都对你心怀感激.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.</i>

736
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:31,853
然而是时候让你卸下你的铠甲和宝剑了.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.

737
00:52:31,887 --> 00:52:34,789
<i>你该安享晚年, 并自豪地回顾...
It is time to rest and look back with pride</i>

738
00:52:34,824 --> 00:52:36,458
你长久以来的功绩了.

陛下, 御林铁卫乃是宣誓效命的兄弟.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.

741
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,297
<i>我们必须终身守誓.
Our vows are taken for life.</i>

742
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:45,835
惟有一死才能解除我们的神圣使命.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

743
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:49,572
是谁的死, 巴利斯坦爵士? 是你还是你的国王?
Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?

744
00:52:49,606 --> 00:52:52,474
<i>我父亲的死就是你的责任.
Joffrey: You let my father die.</i>

745
00:52:52,509 --> 00:52:55,445
你太老了, 谁都保护不了.
You're too old to protect anybody.

746
00:52:57,748 --> 00:53:00,483
- 陛下-- - 御前会议已经决定
- Your Grace-- - The Council has determined

747
00:53:00,518 --> 00:53:02,952
由詹姆兰尼斯特爵士接替你的职务
that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place

748
00:53:02,987 --> 00:53:05,255
<i>担任御林铁卫队长.
as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.</i>

749
00:53:05,289 --> 00:53:06,824
那个人玷污了自己的宝剑
The man who profaned his blade

750
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:09,059
杀死了他宣誓要保护的国王!
with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!

751
00:53:09,094 --> 00:53:11,027
小心一点, 爵士.
Careful, Ser.

752
00:53:11,061 --> 00:53:12,762
我们并非不知感恩
We have nothing but gratitude

753
00:53:12,797 --> 00:53:15,266
您的长期贡献有目共睹, 爵士.
for your long service, good Ser.

754
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,768
您将得到一座坚固的海滨城堡,
You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea,

755
00:53:17,802 --> 00:53:20,137
以及满足您需要的大批仆役.
with servants to look after your every need.

756
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,371
给我一个养老的地方
A hall to die in

757
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,807
<i>以及为我送终的人.
and men to bury me.</i>

758
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:29,445
我既生为一名骑士.
I am a Knight.

759
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,516
也要死得像个骑士.
I shall die a Knight.

760
00:53:38,456 --> 00:53:40,590
像个没穿衣服的骑士, 是吧.
A naked Knight, apparently.

761
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:42,760
( Laughter )

762
00:53:51,735 --> 00:53:55,172
即便现在我仍可以像切蛋糕一样把你们五个通通砍倒!
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!

763
00:53:59,344 --> 00:54:01,878
拿去, 小子!
Here, boy!

764
00:54:01,913 --> 00:54:04,347
把它熔了加到铁王座上吧.
Melt it down and add it to the others.

765
00:54:18,862 --> 00:54:20,829
<i>( Doors creak, clang )</i>

766
00:54:20,864 --> 00:54:23,199
如果在场各位还有其他事...
If any man in this hall has other matters

767
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:26,367
请现在向国王陛下禀报
to set before His Grace, let him speak now

768
00:54:26,402 --> 00:54:29,639
否则退朝.
or go forth and hold his silence.

769
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:34,445
陛下.
Your Grace.

770
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:36,847
请上前来, 小姐.
Come forward, My Lady.

771
00:54:38,617 --> 00:54:41,353
<i>史塔克家族的珊莎小姐.
Steward: The Lady Sansa of House Stark.</i>

772
00:54:42,889 --> 00:54:46,291
珊莎, 你有事禀报国王陛下和御前会议?
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?

773
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:48,159
是的.
I do.

774
00:54:53,032 --> 00:54:56,134
启禀陛下, 我要为我父亲请求您的慈悲,
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,

775
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:59,637
艾德史塔克大人, 前任国王之手.
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.

776
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:02,539
叛国大罪好似带毒的野草.
Treason is a noxious weed.

777
00:55:02,574 --> 00:55:06,744
- 必须连根拔除... - 让她说下去.
- It should be torn out, root-- - Let her speak.

778
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,481
我要听听她的话.
I want to hear what she says.

779
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:11,650
感谢您, 陛下.
Thank you, Your Grace.

780
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,288
你要否认你父亲所犯罪行?
Do you deny your father's crime?

781
00:55:14,322 --> 00:55:18,793
不, 诸位大人. 我明白他必须接受惩罚.
No, My Lords. I know he must be punished.

782
00:55:18,827 --> 00:55:20,827
我请求的只是慈悲为怀.
All I ask is mercy.

783
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:23,731
<i>我知道我父亲必定对其所为懊悔不已.
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.</i>

784
00:55:23,766 --> 00:55:26,068
他是劳勃国王的好友, 他敬爱国王.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.

785
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:28,302
你们知道他是真心敬爱他.
You all know he loved him.

786
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:31,940
他从未想当国王之手, 直到国王要求他.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.

787
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:35,376
他必定是受人蛊惑... 蓝礼大人或史坦尼斯大人
They must have lied to him-- Lord Renly or Lord Stannis

788
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:38,211
或是其他什么人. 他们欺骗了他!
or somebody. They must have lied!

789
00:55:38,246 --> 00:55:40,715
他说我不是国王.
He said I wasn't the King.

790
00:55:40,748 --> 00:55:42,815
他为什么要那样说?
Why did he say that?

791
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:45,119
他受了重伤.
He was badly hurt.

792
00:55:45,152 --> 00:55:48,021
派席尔大学士给他服用了罂粟花奶.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.

793
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:52,224
当时他神智不清. 否则他绝不会那样说的.
He wasn't himself. Otherwise h  never would have said it.

794
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:58,431
孩子对父亲的信赖... 多么单纯天真.
A child's faith... Such sweet innocence.

795
00:55:58,465 --> 00:56:02,135
<i>可是人们不是常说, 智慧之言往往来自
And yet they say wisdom oft comes</i>

796
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,003
孩童之口么.
from the mouths of babes.

797
00:56:04,038 --> 00:56:08,175
但叛国就是叛国!
Treason is treason!

798
00:56:11,313 --> 00:56:13,480
你还有什么事?
Anything else?

799
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:18,452
如果您心里仍然有我,
If you still have any affection in your heart for me,

800
00:56:18,485 --> 00:56:21,987
请成全我这个心愿吧, 陛下.
please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

801
00:56:31,565 --> 00:56:33,831
你的肺腑之言感动了我.
Your sweet words have moved me.

802
00:56:36,235 --> 00:56:38,802
但你父亲必须先俯首认罪.
But your father has to confess.

803
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:42,440
他必须承认我是他的国王...
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...

804
00:56:45,342 --> 00:56:47,478
不然我无法手下留情.
Or there'll be no mercy for him.

805
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:54,050
他一定会的.
He will.

806
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:04,061

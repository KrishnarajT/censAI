<i>你知道你夫人做了什么吗?

15
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:35,753
她所做的都是遵照我的命令.
She did nothing I did not command.

16
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:37,520
谁能想到她会那样做?
Who'd have thought she had it in her?

17
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:39,590
你凭什么对我的家人下手?

你现在是待罪之身.

21
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,866
你们两个能不能都住口?!
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?!

当时史塔克大人喝醉了酒

25
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,210
刚从妓院里出来, 他的手下攻击了詹姆.

26
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,815

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:16,228
我才该穿铠甲, 你应该穿裙子当女人.
I should wear the armor and you the gown.

32
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,641
我会把这当作荣誉奖章.
I shall wear this like a badge of honor.

33
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:37,014
那就给我安静地戴好, 否则我让你更光荣.
Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.

34
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,263
看到她是如何待我的了?
See what she does to me?

35
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:56,265
我亲爱的妻子.
My loving wife.

36
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:04,307
我不该打她的.
I should not have hit her.

37
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,443
这实在不是...
That was not...

38
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,746
实在不是国王该有的举动.
That was not Kingly.

39
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:14,186
如果我们不采取措施,
If we don't act,

40
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,522
将会爆发一场战争.
there will be a war.

41
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,424
那就叫你夫人放那个小恶魔...
So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp

42
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,861
回君临.
to King's Landing.

43
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,563
她已经玩够了, 别再继续了.
She's had her fun, now put an end to it.

44
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,869
你听到没有? 送只渡鸦去解决这件事.
You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.

45
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,705
那么詹姆兰尼斯特怎么处理?
And what about Jaime Lannister?

46
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,010
- 詹姆怎么处理? - 我几乎把半个王国
- What about Jaime? - I'm half a Kingdom in debt

47
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,412
都抵押给了他那该死的老爸.
to his bloody father.

48
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,351
我不知道你和那帮黄头发的混蛋有什么过节.
I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits.

49
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:47,121
我也不想知道. 关键的问题是...
I don't want to know. This is what matters...

50
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:49,189
我将无法维持对七国的统治
I can't rule the Kingdoms

51
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:52,226
如果史塔克家和兰尼斯特家打成一团.
if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats.

52
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,494
所以到此为止吧.
So enough.

53
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:58,833
遵命, 陛下.
As you command, Your Grace.

54
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:01,337
如果您允许,
With your leave,

55
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:04,506
我会返回临冬城处理此事.
I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.

56
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,441
不行. 送只渡鸦去吧.
Piss on that. Send a raven.

57
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,109
我要你留下来.
I want you to stay.

58
00:05:08,143 --> 00:05:11,213
我是国王. 我说什么就是什么.
I'm the King. I get what I want.

59
00:05:15,952 --> 00:05:19,421
我没喜欢过我的亲兄弟们.
I never loved my brothers.

60
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:23,159
这很令人伤心, 但事实如此.
A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.

61
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:29,032
你才是我的兄弟.
You were the brother I chose.

62
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:37,875
等我打猎回来再谈吧.
We'll talk when I return from the hunt.

63
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:41,845
打猎?
The hunt?

64
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,282
打猎能令我头脑清爽.
Killing things clears my head.

65
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:48,053
我不在时你必须代我坐那把铁骑子.
You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away.

66
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:50,789
你一定会比我更讨厌它.
You'll hate it more than I do.

67
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:52,556
坦格利安家那女孩...
The Targaryen girl...

68
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:56,160
七层地狱啊, 不要再提她了.
seven hells, don't start with her again.

69
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:59,030
那女孩必须死, 我不想再谈这件事.
The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.

70
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:02,099
把徽章戴上. 要是你再把它摘下来,
Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again,

71
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:06,236
我向圣母发誓我会把这烂东西给詹姆兰尼斯特.
I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.

72
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,775
卡丽煕?
Khaleesi?

73
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:34,147
哦, 卡丽煕!
Oh, Khaleesi!

74
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:47,128
你受伤了.
You're hurt.

75
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:44,017
- 别太快了. - 快点, 小舞.
- Not too fast. - Come on, Dancer.

76
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:45,919
你准备何时告诉他?
When are you gonna tell him?

77
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:48,021
现在不行.
Not now.

78
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:49,823
- 血债血还. - 快点!
- Blood for blood. - Bran: Come on!

79
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:52,358
你必须让兰尼斯特家为乔里他们的死付出代价.
You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others.

80
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:54,694
<i>- 你是在谈论战争. - 我是在谈论正义.
- Robb: You're talking about war. - I'm talking about justice.</i>

81
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,963
只有临冬城主

82
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:58,966
才能召集封臣出动军队.

兰尼斯特家的人用矛刺伤了你父亲的腿.
A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg.

84
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:04,304
弑君者跑回凯岩城去避风头了...
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him...

85
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,208
你要我进攻凯岩城吗?
you want me to march on Casterly Rock?

86
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,510
<i>- 你不是小孩子了. - 快点.
- You're not a boy anymore. - Bran: Come on.</i>

87
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:11,512
他们攻击你父亲. 他们已经挑起战争了.
They attacked your father. They've already started the war.

88
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:15,751
你父亲不在时, 你要负责代表你的家族.
It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.

89
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:19,421
而不用你来负责, 因为不是你的家族.
And it's not your duty, because it's not your House.

90
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:31,533
布兰去哪儿了?
Where's Bran?

91
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,637
我不知道. 又不是我的家族.
I don't know. It's not my House.

92
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,773
罗柏?
Robb?

93
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:15,110
孤身一人在幽暗的树林里.
All alone in the deep, dark woods.

94
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:20,247
我不是一个人. 我和我哥哥在一起.
I'm not alone. My brother is with me.

95
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:21,982
我可没看见他.
I don't see him.

96
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:23,985
你把他藏在斗篷下面了?
Got him hidden under your cloak?

97
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,221
哦, 真是个漂亮的别针.
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

98
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:28,890
- 是银子的. - 我们要那别针

快一点.
Be quick about it.

101
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:36,731
我下不来.
I can't.

102
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:38,833
这马鞍... 这皮带.
The saddle... the straps.

103
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,338
你有什么毛病? 你是残废?
What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?

104
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,041
我是临冬城的布兰登史塔克.
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

105
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:49,310
要是再不放手, 我会让你们通通没命!
If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!

106
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,980
把他的小鸡鸡割下来塞他嘴里.
Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.

107
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:54,382
这孩子死了就不值钱啦.
The boy's worth nothing dead.

108
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,617
班扬史塔克的亲属?
Benjen Stark's own blood?

109
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:59,921
<i>想想看曼斯会怎么奖励我们.
Think what Mance would give us.</i>

110
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:03,326
曼斯雷德和北境通通见鬼去吧.
Piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North.

111
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,562
我们要去南方, 越远越好.
We're going as far South as South goes.

112
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:10,131
多恩那里不会有异鬼.
There ain't no White Walkers down in Dorne.

113
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,467
放下刀子!
Drop the knife!

114
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:15,471
放开他, 我会给你们留条活路.
Let him go and I'll let you live.

115
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:37,458
罗柏.
Robb.

116
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:40,395
- 罗柏. - 闭嘴.
- Robb. - Shut up.

117
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:42,730
把剑扔了!
Drop the blade!

118
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:44,866
- 不, 不要. - 快点.
- No, don't. - Do it.

119
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:25,270
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

120
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:28,040
是的. 一点也不痛.
Yes. It doesn't hurt.

121
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:30,943
坚强的小伙子.
Tough little lad.

122
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:34,481
<i>在铁群岛, 你必须杀死过一个敌人才算成人.
In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy.</i>

123
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:36,116
干得好.
Well done.

124
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,017
你发疯了吗?
Have you lost your mind?

125
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,853
要是你没射中怎么办?
What if you'd missed?

126
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:43,289
他会杀掉你再割断布兰的喉咙.
He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.

127
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:45,924
- 你没权利... - 没权利做什么, 救你兄弟的命?
- You don't have the right... - To what, to save your brother's life?

128
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,827
这是唯一选择, 所以我做了.
It was the only thing to do, so I did it.

129
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:52,597
她怎么处理?
What about her?

130
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:01,439
饶我一命, 大人, 我是您的人了.
Give me my life, My Lord, and I'm yours.

131
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:05,209
饶她一命吧.
We'll keep her alive.

132
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:30,934
莫德!
Mord!

133
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:34,204
开门! 莫德!
Turnkey! Mord!

134
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:37,641
莫德!
Mord!

135
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:43,583
小矮人真吵闹!
Dwarf man making noise!

136
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:47,886
你想不想发财?
How would you like to be rich?

小矮人还在吵闹.
Dwarf man still making noise.

138

我们有金子, 很多金子.
We have gold, lots of gold.

我打算给你很多很多金子...
I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in...

141
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,867
没有金子!
No gold!

142
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:03,903
嗯, 我身上没有.
Well, I don't have it here.

143
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:06,338
没有金子.
No gold.

144
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:08,073
混帐.
Fuck off.

145
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,236
我今天不想练习.
I don't want to practice today.

146
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,605
不想?
No?

147
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,041
他们杀了乔里.
They killed Jory.

148
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:43,977
我父亲也受伤了.
My father is hurt.

149
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:46,514
我不想再练这愚蠢的木剑了.
I don't care about stupid wooden swords.

150
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:48,381
你有烦恼了.
You are troubled.

151
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,083
<i>- 是的. - 很好!
- Yes. - Good!</i>

152
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:52,352
烦恼的时候最适合练习.
Trouble is the perfect time for training.

153
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:55,689
当你在草地上与玩偶和猫咪一起跳舞,
When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens,

154
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,659
那可不是适合练习打斗的时候.
this is not when fighting happens.

155
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:59,962
我不喜欢玩偶和...
I don't like dolls and k...

156
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:02,898
<i>你心不在焉.
You're not here.</i>

157
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:05,901
<i>你在烦恼.
You're with your trouble.</i>

158
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:08,670
如果在打斗时你还在烦恼...
If you are with your trouble when fighting happens...

159
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:14,544
...你会有更大的麻烦.
...More trouble for you.

160
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:16,780
<i>就是这样.
Just so.</i>

161
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,850
你如何能迅如蛇...
How can you be quick as a snake...

162
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:27,055
...或者静如影...
...Or as quiet as a shadow...

163
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:34,130
...如果你心不在焉?
...When you are somewhere else?

164
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:38,767
你在担心你的父亲, 嗯?
You are fearing for your father, hmm?

165
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:43,271
那是对的.
That is right.

166
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:46,541
- 你有向诸神祈祷吗? - 旧神和新神.
- Do you pray to the gods? - The old and the new.

167
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:50,881
只有一个神
There is only one God

168
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:53,818
那就是死神.
and his name is Death.

169
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,853
我们向死神只说一句话:
And there is only one thing we say to Death:

170
00:15:57,988 --> 00:15:59,957
"今天不行."
"Not today."

171
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,568
<i>(男孩! 男孩! 强壮的男孩!
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!</i>

172
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,171
<i>- (王子骑着马!) - (男孩! 男孩! 强壮的男孩!)
- Priestess: Khalakka Dothrae! - Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!</i>

173
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,607
<i>- (男孩! 男孩! 强壮的男孩!) - 王子骑着马!
- Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj! - Khalakka Dothrae!</i>

174
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,451
她必须吃掉那一整颗心吗?
She has to eat the whole heart?

175
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,286
我希望那不是我的马.
I hope that wasn't my horse.

176
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,155
她做得很好.
She's doing well.

177
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:34,190
她吃不下的.
She'll never keep it down.

178
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,360
(男孩! 男孩! 强壮的男孩!)
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!

179
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,895
<i>(王子骑着马!)
Khalakka Dothrae!</i>

180
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:55,648
<i>(王子骑着马!)
Khalakka Dothrae!</i>

181
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,517
告诉我她在说什么.
Tell me what she's saying.

182
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,054
"王子骑着马.
"The prince is riding.

183
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,089
我听见他的蹄声隆隆.
I have heard the thunder of his hooves.

184
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:07,525
他的马迅捷如风.
Swift as the wind he rides.

185
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,829
他的敌人将在他面前颤抖...
His enemies will cower before him...

186
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:16,800
敌人的妻子们将悲伤泣血."
And their wives will weep tears of blood."

187
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,673
她将生下一个男孩.
She's going to have a boy.

188
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,046
他不会是一个真正的坦格利安.
He won't be a real Targaryen.

189
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,483
他不会是一条真龙.
He won't be a true Dragon.

190
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,838
<i>(骑着世界的骏马!)
Vezh fin saja rhaesheseres!</i>

191
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,974
"骑着世界的骏马."
"The stallion who mounts the world."

192
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:30,011
那骏马将是卡奥中的卡奥.
The stallion is the Khal of Khals.

193
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:33,147
他将统一所有的卡拉萨.
He shall unite the people into a single Khalasar.

194
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:36,550
<i>全世界的人都将属于他.
All the people of the world will be his herd.</i>

195
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:38,785
<i>(...骑着世界!)
...Rhaesheseres!</i>

196
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,987
<i>(骑着世界!)
Rhaesheseres!</i>

197
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,987
<i>(王子在我体内骑马!)</i>

198
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:47,987
<i>(他的名字叫做雷戈!)</i>

199
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:51,698
雷戈! 雷戈!
Rhaego! Rhaego!

200
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,868
雷戈! 雷戈!
Rhaego! Rhaego!

201
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:56,669
雷戈! 雷戈...
Rhaego! Rhaego...

202
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,410
他们爱戴她.
They love her.

203
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,246
雷戈! 雷戈!
Rhaego! Rhaego!

204
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,016
雷戈! 雷戈...
Rhaego! Rhaego...

205
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,505
今天她是一位真正的王后了.
She truly is a queen today.

206
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,302
别让他们看到你在维斯多斯拉克带着剑.
Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.

207
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:06,469
你知道这违反律法.
You know the law.

208
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:08,471
这律法管不着我.
It's not my law.

209
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:10,475
它们不是属于你的.
They don't belong to you.

210
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,910
她的东西都是属于我的.
Whatever is hers is also mine.

211
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,581
或许曾经属于你.
Once, perhaps.

212
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,352
如果我卖掉一颗龙蛋, 就足够买一条船.
If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship.

213
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,554
卖两颗... 一条船加一支军队.
Two eggs... a ship and an army.

214
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,891
- 你拿了三颗. - 我需要一支大军.
- And you have all three. - I need a large army.

215
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:30,063
我是一个王朝复兴最后的希望, 莫尔蒙.
I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont.

216
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,233
世界上古往今来最伟大的王朝
The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen

217
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:34,768
自五岁起我就担负着这项使命...
on my shoulders since I was five years old...

218
00:20:34,803 --> 00:20:37,804
却从没人给予我在那帐篷里他们所给予她的东西.
and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent.

219
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,707
从来没有.
Never.

220
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,975
一点也没有.
Not a piece of it.

221
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,678
没有这些我如何能履行我的使命?
How can I carry what I need to carry without it?

222
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,412
嗯?
Hmm?

223
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:48,881
没有财富或恐惧或爱戴如何能进行统治?
Who can rule without wealth or fear or love?

224
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:57,123
哦, 你站在那里, 又高贵又荣誉.
Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor.

225
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,996
你以为我没发现你是用何种眼神看着我的妹妹, 嗯?
You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm?

226
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:05,566
你以为我不知道你想要什么?
Don't think I know what you want?

227
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:11,506
我无所谓. 你可以拥有她.
I don't care. You can have her.

228
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,808
她可以当蛮子的王后并且尽情...
She can be Queen of the savages and dine

229
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:15,777
享用那最美味的马的器官,
on the finest bloody horseparts,

230
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:18,613
你也可以尽情享用她的任何器官.
and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like.

231
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:22,284
让我走吧.
But let me go.

232
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:25,954
你可以走.
You can go.

233
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:27,822
但你不能带走龙蛋.
You can't have the eggs.

234
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:29,622
你曾向我宣誓效忠.
You swore an oath to me.

235
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:32,159
忠诚对你来说不值一提吗?
Does loyalty mean nothing to you?

236
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,361
那是我的一切.
It means everything to me.

237
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,396
然而你还是站在这里.
And yet here you stand.

238
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,531
所以我还是站在这里.
And yet here I stand.

239
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:57,083
莫德!
Mord!

240
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:59,352
莫德!
Mord!

241
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,622
莫德!
Mord!

242
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,361
莫德!
Mord!

243
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:12,165
莫德.
Mord.

244
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,200
又在吵闹了!
Noise again!

245
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:20,407
- 有关那些金子... - 没有金子!
- About the gold... - No gold!

246
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:22,877
- 没有金子. - 听我说!
- No gold. - Listen to me!

247
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,978
听我说.
Listen to me.

248
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:27,215
有时候财产
Sometimes possession

249
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:29,351
是个抽象的概念...
is an abstract concept...

250
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:33,922
他们抓我的时候拿走了我的钱包,
When they captured me, they took my purse,

251
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:35,925
但那些金子还是我的.
but the gold is still mine.

252
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,727
在哪儿?
Where?

253
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:39,861
在哪儿? 我不知道在哪儿,
Where? I don't know where,

254
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:41,196
但等他们给我自由的时候...
but when they free me...

255
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,631
你想要自由?
You want free?

256
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:45,900
那儿有自由.
Go be free.

257
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:49,336
你有没有听说过这句话
Have you ever heard the phrase

258
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:51,304
"象兰尼斯特家一样有钱"?
"rich as a Lannister"?

259
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:55,910
<i>你当然听说过!
Of course you have!</i>

260
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:58,880
你是个聪明人.
You're a smart man.

261
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:01,749
你知道兰尼斯特家.
You know who the Lannisters are.

262
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:05,620
我就是兰尼斯特家的.
I am a Lannister.

263
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:09,323
泰温之子提利昂!
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

264
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,429
而且, 你当然也听说过这句话,
And of course, you have also heard the phrase,

265
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:16,800
"兰尼斯特有债必还."
"a Lannister always pays his debts."

266
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:21,170
如果你替我传个口信...
If you deliver a message from me...

267
00:23:22,273 --> 00:23:25,641
给艾林夫人, 就算我欠你一笔债.
to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt.

268
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,746
我会给你很多金子.
I will owe you gold.

269
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:33,249
如果你传了口信
If you deliver the message

270
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:37,121
如果我活下来了, 我一定会的.
and I live, which I very much intend to do.

271
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:41,558
什么口信?
What message?

272
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:50,868
告诉她我打算认罪.
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.

273
00:23:57,243 --> 00:24:00,277
你打算认罪?
You wish to confess your crimes?

274
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,947
是的, 夫人.
Yes, My Lady.

275
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,515
我愿意, 夫人.
I do, My Lady.

276
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:06,884
天牢可以让任何人屈服.
The sky cells always break them.

277
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,121
说吧, 小恶魔.
Speak, Imp.

278
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,556
坦诚地面对诸神吧.
Meet your gods as an honest man.

279
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:19,998
该从何说起呢, 各位大人和夫人?
Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?

280
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:23,169
我是个坏蛋,
I'm a vile man,

281
00:24:23,202 --> 00:24:25,103
我承认这一点.
I confess it.

282
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:28,140
我犯下的罪过数不胜数.
My crimes and sins are beyond counting.

283
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,310
<i>我撒过谎骗过人...
I have lied and cheated...</i>

284
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:34,779
<i>赌过钱嫖过妓.
gambled and whored.</i>

285
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:38,450
<i>我不是特别擅长暴力,
I'm not particularly good at violence,</i>

286
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:41,920
但我擅长鼓动他人替我施暴.
but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me.

287
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:46,692
我想你是想听具体一点的.
You want specifics, I suppose.

288
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:50,631
七岁那年, 我看见一个女仆
When I was seven I saw a servant girl

289
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:52,632
在河里洗澡.
bathing in the river.

290
00:24:52,668 --> 00:24:54,535
我偷走了她的衣服.
I stole her robe.

291
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,902
于是她不得不...
She was forced to return to the castle

292
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:58,938
光着身子哭着回城堡.
naked and in tears.

293
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,274
如果我闭上眼睛,
If I close my eyes,

294
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:05,511
还能看见她跳动的乳头.
I can still see her tits bouncing.

295
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:12,015
十岁那年, 我在我叔叔的靴子里塞满羊粪.
When I was 10 I stuffed my Uncle's boots with goatshit.

296
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:14,451
<i>别人问我的时候,
When confronted with my crime,</i>

297
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:16,955
我归咎于一个侍从. 那可怜孩子挨了鞭打
I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged

298
00:25:16,988 --> 00:25:19,224
而我却逃脱了惩罚.
and I escaped justice.

299
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:21,025
<i>十二岁那年
When I was 12</i>

300
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,062
我朝一锅炖海龟猛挤我那小鳗鱼...
I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew.

301
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:27,132
猛扭我那小独眼蛇...
I flogged the one-eyed snake.

302
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,168
猛搓我那小香肠...
I skinned my sausage.

303
00:25:29,202 --> 00:25:32,404
猛揍我那爱哭的小秃子...
I made the bald man cry

304
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,440
<i>给那炖海龟加了点作料,
into the turtle stew,</i>

305
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:36,476
我相信我老姐把它吃了.
which I do believe my sister ate.

306
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:38,445
<i>至少我希望她吃了.
At least I hope she did.</i>

307
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:40,813
有一回我又带了一头公驴和一个蜂窝
Once I brought a jackass and a honeycomb

308
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:43,015
- 去一家妓院... - 住口!
- into a brothel... - Silence!

309
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:44,650
后来怎么样了?
What happened next?

310
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:48,686
你以为你在干什么?
What do you think you're doing?

311
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,654
我在认罪啊.
Confessing my crimes.

312
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:53,224
提利昂大人, 你被控
Lord Tyrion, you are accused

313
00:25:53,257 --> 00:25:56,727
雇人行刺我卧病在床的儿子布兰,
of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed,

314
00:25:56,762 --> 00:25:59,564
<i>以及密谋害死我妹妹的丈夫
and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband</i>

315
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,436
琼恩艾林大人, 国王之手.
Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.

316
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,804
哦, 我非常抱歉.
Oh, I'm very sorry.

317
00:26:06,974 --> 00:26:08,909
我对这些一无所知.
I don't know anything about all that.

318
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:12,279
你的玩笑开够了.
You've had your little joke.

319
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:14,682
我相信你玩得很愉快.
I trust you enjoyed it.

320
00:26:14,717 --> 00:26:17,585
莫德, 带他回地牢.
Mord, take him back to the dungeon.

321
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,954
这次找个更小的房间...
But this time find a smaller cell...

322
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:22,090
而且地板也更斜的.
With a steeper floor.

323
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,892
难道这就是所谓
Is this how justice

324
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:26,794
艾林谷的正义?
is done in the Vale?

325
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:29,397
<i>你指控我有罪,
You accuse me of crimes,</i>

326
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:32,600
我否认有罪, 所以你把我扔进牢房
I deny them, so you throw me into a cell

327
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,502
<i>冻饿而死?
to freeze and starve?</i>

328
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:37,471
国王的正义到哪里去了?
Where is the King's Justice?

329
00:26:37,506 --> 00:26:40,875
既然我遭到指控, 我要求公平审判!
I am accused and demand a trial!

330
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:44,546
如果你被判有罪,
If you're tried and found guilty,

331
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:47,683
那么依照国王的律法你只有死路一条.
then by the King's own laws you will pay with your life.

332
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:50,821
我尊重律法.
I understand the law.

333
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:53,422
我们鹰巢城没有刽子手.
We have no executioner in the Eyrie.

334
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,259
我们这里有更文雅的法子.
Life is more elegant here.

335
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:58,227
打开月门.
Open the moon door.

336
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:21,850
<i>你想要一场审判, 兰尼斯特大人.
You want a trial, My Lord Lannister.</i>

337
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:23,884
很好.
Very well.

338
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,888
我儿子会倾听你要说的话,
My son will listen to whatever you have to say,

339
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:29,189
而你将接受他的判决.
and you will hear his judgment.

340
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:31,325
然后你就可以离开...
Then you will leave...

341
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:33,495
从这道门或那道门.
By one door or the other.

342
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:36,730
不必惊动罗宾大人了.
No need to bother Lord Robin.

343
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:40,401
我要求比武审判.
I demand a trial by combat.

344
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,911
你当然有这个权利.
You have that right.

345
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,881
夫人, 我请您恩准.
My Lady, I beg the honor.

346
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,883
让我做您的代理骑士.
Let me be your champion.

347
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:58,319
这份荣幸应该归我所有.
The honor should be mine.

348
00:27:58,353 --> 00:28:00,588
看在我对您夫君敬爱有加的份上,
For the love I bore your Lord husband,

349
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:02,423
让我替他报仇罢.
let me avenge his death.

350
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,993
<i>- 我愿为您而战, 夫人. - 这将是我的荣幸.
- I'll fight for you, My Lady. - It'll be my honor.</i>

351
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:08,361
- 这将是我的荣幸. - 让这坏蛋飞!
- The honor should be mine. - Make the bad man fly!

352
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:12,333
瓦狄斯爵士...
Ser Vardis...

353
00:28:12,368 --> 00:28:14,535
你怎么不说话.
You're quiet.

354
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,469
你不想为我丈夫报仇吗?
Don't you want to avenge my husband?

355
00:28:18,473 --> 00:28:21,042
我全心全意爱戴他, 夫人.
With all my heart, My Lady.

356
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,009
但这小恶魔只有我一半高.
But the Imp is half my size.

357
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:26,179
把宰杀这种人称作主持正义是可耻的.
It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.

358
00:28:26,214 --> 00:28:28,282
同意.
Agreed.

359
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:31,250
是你要求比武审判的.
You demanded a trial by combat.

360
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:34,621
我要找一位代理骑士. 我和你一样有此权利.
Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.

361
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:36,622
夫人,
My Lady,

362
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:40,127
我很乐意为您与小恶魔的代理骑士决斗.
I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.

363
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,662
我也非常乐意, 爵士.
I wouldn't be too glad, Ser.

364
00:28:42,697 --> 00:28:45,198
我选择我的兄弟詹姆.
I name my brother Jaime Lannister.

365
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:47,433
<i>弑君者
The Kingslayer</i>

366
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:49,436
离这儿有好几百里地.
is hundreds of miles from here.

367
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:52,072
送只渡鸦给他. 我很乐意等.
Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.

368
00:28:52,974 --> 00:28:55,141
今天就必须审判.
The trial will be today.

369
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,648
有人愿意代表我吗?
Do I have a volunteer?

370
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,025
有人吗?
Anyone?

371
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:13,062
有人吗?
Anyone?

372
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:18,300
我想肯定没人愿意...
I think we can assume that no one is willing...

373
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,369
我代表侏儒上场吧.
I'll stand for the dwarf.

374
00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:33,980
再喝口酒吧, 陛下?
More wine, Your Grace?

375
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:38,419
- 我刚才说到哪儿了? - 更单纯的时光.
- What was I saying? - Renly: Simpler time.

376
00:29:38,454 --> 00:29:41,790
是的! 是的. 你年纪太小不记得了.
It was! It was. You're too young to remember.

377
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,525
是不是更单纯, 塞尔弥?
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

378
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,028
- 是的, 陛下. - 敌人都在明处,
- It was, Your Grace. - The enemy was right  in the open,

379
00:29:47,063 --> 00:29:51,266
虽然很邪恶, 但是绝对开诚布公.
vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation.

380
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:53,269
一点也不象现在.
Nothing like today.

381
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:56,171
- 听起来很令人兴奋. - 令人兴奋, 是的.
- It sounds exhilarating. - Exhilarating, yes.

382
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:58,573
也许不如那些舞会
Not as exhilarating as those balls

383
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:01,009
你喜欢的化妆舞会.
and masquerades you like to throw.

384
00:30:05,948 --> 00:30:08,416
你上过河间地的姑娘吗?
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?

385
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:10,083
有一次. 我想.
Once. I think.

386
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:13,920
你想? 我想你应该记得.
You think? I think you'd remember.

387
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:16,890
我们那时候, 如果你没有...
Back in our day, you weren't a real man

388
00:30:16,925 --> 00:30:20,026
上全七国每一国的姑娘就不能算是真男人
until you'd fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms

389
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:21,795
另外还要加上河间地的.
and the Riverlands.

390
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,065
<i>- 我们称之为 "满八." - 那真是些幸运的姑娘.
- We used to call it "making the eight." - Those were some lucky girls.</i>

391
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,134
你完成过满八吗, 巴利斯坦?
You ever make the eight, Barristan?

392
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:29,137
我想没有, 陛下.
I don't believe so, Your Grace.

393
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,038
那真是些好日子.
Those were the days.

394
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:32,841
你是说什么日子?
Which days, exactly?

395
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:36,378
是半个维斯特洛打另半个, 死了成千上万人的日子?
The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died?

396
00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:39,648
还是在那之前, 疯王屠杀妇女和婴儿的日子
Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies

397
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:42,583
只因他头脑里有个声音要他这样做?
because the voices in his head told him they deserved it?

398
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:45,986
还是更早之前, 恶龙将城市烧成白地的日子?
Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?

399
00:30:46,021 --> 00:30:48,188
别紧张, 小子.
Easy, boy.

400
00:30:48,224 --> 00:30:51,191
你是我的兄弟, 但你也是在对国王说话.
You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.

401
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:52,960
我想那确实算是英雄壮举...
I suppose it was all rather heroic...

402
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:55,830
当你喝醉酒后找个可怜的河间地女人
If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore

403
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:58,498
放进你那话儿并完成所谓的满八.
to shove your prick inside and make the eight.

404
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:04,473
再喝口酒吧, 陛下?
More wine, Your Grace?

405
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:24,361
<i>他们几乎烧掉了河间地的所有东西:
They burned most everything in the Riverlands:</i>

406
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:28,564
<i>我们的田地; 我们的粮仓;
Our fields; Our granaries;</i>

407
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:31,000
我们的家.
our homes.

408
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:35,170
<i>他们抢走我们的女人, 强奸她们.
They took our women, then they took 'em again.</i>

409
00:31:35,206 --> 00:31:37,806
然后还把她们杀死
When they was done, they butchered them

410
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:39,642
就象是杀死牲畜.
as if they was animals.

411
00:31:39,677 --> 00:31:41,812
他们在我们的孩子身上
They covered our children

412
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:43,648
浇柏油
in pitch

413
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:45,583
然后放火烧.
and lit them on fire.

414
00:31:46,752 --> 00:31:48,753
最大的可能是土匪.
Brigands, most likely.

415
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:51,157
他们不是毛贼.
They weren't thieves.

416
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,793
他们并不偷东西.
They didn't steal nothing.

417
00:31:53,826 --> 00:31:57,228
他们甚至扔了点东西, 陛下.
They even left something behind, Your Grace.

418
00:31:57,264 --> 00:32:00,666
你们面前的是国王之手, 不是国王.
It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the King.

419
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,633
国王去打猎了.
The King is hunting.

420
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:13,945
鱼. 徒利家族的标志.
Fish. The Sigil of House Tully.

421
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:17,748
那是您夫人的家族吧... 徒利, 首相大人?
Isn't that your wife's house... Tully, My Lord Hand?

422
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:25,823
那些人佩戴什么纹章?
These men, were they flying a Sigil?

423
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:29,627
- 打什么旗帜? - 没有, 陛...
- A banner? - None, your...

424
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,262
首相.
Hand.

425
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:33,130
<i>领头的那个人...
The one who was leading them...</i>

426
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:36,668
比我见过最高的人还高一尺,
Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met,

427
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:40,037
我亲眼见他把我们的铁匠砍成两半,
saw him cut the blacksmith in two,

428
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:42,473
还亲眼见他砍掉一匹马的头
saw him take the head off a horse

429
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:45,009
只用他的剑挥了一下.
with a single swing of his sword.

430
00:32:45,044 --> 00:32:47,579
听着象我们认识的某个人.
That sounds like someone we know.

431
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:49,715
魔山.
The Mountain.

432
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:52,817
你说的是格雷果克里冈爵士.
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

433
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:55,821
格雷果爵士怎么会成土匪?
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?

434
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:58,022
他是个受封的骑士.
The man is an anointed knight.

435
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:01,124
我听说他被称为泰温兰尼斯特的疯狗.
I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

436
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:03,394
我相信你也听说过.
I'm sure you have as well.

437
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:05,429
您知道为什么
Can you think of any reason

438
00:33:05,464 --> 00:33:07,265
兰尼斯特家的人
the Lannisters might possibly have

439
00:33:07,298 --> 00:33:08,967
对您夫人有这么大的火气吗?
for being angry with your wife?

440
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,768
<i>如果真是兰尼斯特家
Maester Pycelle: If the Lannisters</i>

441
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:14,104
下令攻击
were to order attacks on villages

442
00:33:14,139 --> 00:33:16,373
受国王保护的村庄,
under the King's protection,

443
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:19,177
- 那将... - 那将等于是
- it would be... - That would be almost as brazen

444
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,246
公然在都城的大街上攻击国王之手.
as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.

445
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:24,682
嗯...
Well...

446
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:30,823
我无法归还你们的家园
I cannot give you back your homes

447
00:33:30,856 --> 00:33:33,558
<i>更不能将死者复生,
or restore your dead to life,</i>

448
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:35,561
但或许我能还你们一个公道
but perhaps I can give you justice

449
00:33:35,595 --> 00:33:38,229
<i>以我们的国王劳勃之名.
in the name of our King, Robert.</i>

450
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:41,600
贝里唐德利恩大人.
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

451
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:49,341
你立刻率领一百名士兵
You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men

452
00:33:49,374 --> 00:33:53,077
- 驰往格雷果爵士的城堡. - 遵命.
- and ride to Ser Gregor's keep. - As you command.

453
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:03,287
以拜拉席德家族的,
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,

454
00:34:03,313 --> 00:34:03,322
劳勃一世,
the first of his name,

455
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:07,192
安达尔人与先民的国王, 七国统治者
King of the Andals and the first men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

456
00:34:07,227 --> 00:34:09,462
暨全境守护者之名,
and protector of the realm,

457
00:34:09,496 --> 00:34:11,730
我命令你实施国王的正义
I charge you to bring the King's Justice

458
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,801
处置虚伪的骑士格雷果克里冈
to the false knight Gregor Clegane

459
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:16,303
以及所有与他合谋的共犯.
and all those who shared in his crimes.

460
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:18,239
谴责其恶行
I denounce him

461
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:20,241
取消其权利.
and attaint him.

462
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:23,576
褫夺其一切官阶及头衔,
I strip him of all ranks and titles,

463
00:34:23,612 --> 00:34:27,279
<i>一切封地及财产,
of all lands and holdings,</i>

464
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,683
- 并判处其死刑. - 大人...
- and sentence him to death. - My Lord...

465
00:34:30,717 --> 00:34:33,685
这... 这是一项重大的举措.
This... this is a drastic action.

466
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:36,489
最好先等劳勃国王回来.
It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.

467
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:38,957
- 派席尔大学士. - 大人.
- Grand Maester Pycelle. - My Lord.

468
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,362
送一只渡鸦去凯岩城.
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

469
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:44,732
通知泰温兰尼斯特前来宫廷
Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court

470
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,833
<i>对其封臣的罪行作出解释.
to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.</i>

471
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:51,004
他必须在两周内赶到, 否则将被视为王室的敌人
He will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown

472
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:54,708
国家的叛徒.
and a traitor to the realm.

473
00:35:07,824 --> 00:35:10,692
真是英勇的举动, 大人, 令人赞赏.
A bold move, My Lord, and admirable.

474
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:13,261
但是拉扯狮子尾巴是否明智呢?
But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?

475
00:35:13,297 --> 00:35:16,799
泰温兰尼斯特是七国上下最富有的人.
Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms.

476
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,870
战争是靠黄金而非士兵打赢的.
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

477
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:23,239
那为什么是劳勃成为国王
Then how come Robert is King

478
00:35:23,272 --> 00:35:25,574
而非泰温兰尼斯特呢?
and not Tywin Lannister?

479
00:35:58,009 --> 00:36:01,612
<i>坚持住!
Hold!</i>

480
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:03,882
<i>- 进攻, 进攻! - 快点, 瓦狄斯爵士!
- Attack attack! - Come on, Ser Vardis!</i>

481
00:36:03,915 --> 00:36:06,884
<i>进攻!
Attack!</i>

482
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:12,690
站住了打, 懦夫!
Stand and fight, coward!

483
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,754
是的!
Yes!

484
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:21,428
够了, 瓦狄斯爵士! 快收拾他.
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

485
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:42,750
<i>你怎么了? 站起来!
What are you doing? Get up!</i>

486
00:37:42,785 --> 00:37:45,853
<i>站起来, 站起来, 站起来!
Get up, get up, get up!</i>

487
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:50,091
<i>快举剑. 举剑!
Raise your sword. Raise it!</i>

488
00:37:53,395 --> 00:37:54,995
起来, 兄弟!
Get up, man!

489
00:37:55,029 --> 00:37:56,730
<i>- 快站起来! - 起来!
- On your feet! - Get up!</i>

490
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:59,399
<i>起来战斗, 瓦狄斯爵士!
Get up and fight, Ser Vardis!</i>

491
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:16,181
<i>不! 饶他一命!
No! Have mercy!</i>

492
00:38:40,808 --> 00:38:43,011
结束了?
Is it over?

493
00:38:47,082 --> 00:38:50,083
你的打法没有荣誉可言!
You don't fight with honor!

494
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,355
没有.
No.

495
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,292
他有荣誉.
He did.

496
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:14,074
现在我可以看那小坏蛋飞了吗?
Can I make the little man fly now?

497
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:16,042
这个小坏蛋可不会飞.
Not this little man.

498
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:18,444
这个小坏蛋要回家了.
This little man is going home.

499
00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:22,549
我想你拿了我的东西.
I believe you have something of mine.

500
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:45,373
兰尼斯特有债必还.
A Lannister always pays his debts.

501
00:40:02,658 --> 00:40:02,723
现在你的头发梳得真象一个南方淑女.
You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.

502
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:10,198
嗯, 为什么不呢? 我们现在是在南方呀.
Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the South.

503
00:40:10,232 --> 00:40:13,569
记得你来自哪里是很重要的.
It's important to remember where you come from.

504
00:40:13,603 --> 00:40:16,839
我不确定你母亲是否会喜欢这些新发型.
I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.

505
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,576
<i>我母亲也不是来自北境.
My mother isn't from the North.</i>

506
00:40:20,944 --> 00:40:22,779
我知道这一点.
I'm aware of that.

507
00:40:22,812 --> 00:40:24,614
你为什么关心这个?
Why do you care?

508
00:40:24,647 --> 00:40:26,315
你自己有头发吗?
Do you even have hair under there?

509
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,785
是的. 我有头发.
Yes. I have hair.

510
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:31,587
我从没看到过.
I've never seen it.

511
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:33,756
你想看吗?
Would you like to?

512
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,826
不.
No.

513
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:40,397
你是来自哪里呢? 南方还是北方?
Where are you from anyway? The North or the South?

514
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,801
我来自一个很小的村庄, 是在...
I come from a very small village in...

515
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:46,103
哦, 等等.
Oh, wait.

516
00:40:46,136 --> 00:40:48,571
我刚发现我不关心这个.
I just realized I don't care.

517
00:40:48,605 --> 00:40:50,841
- 珊莎... - 修女.
- Sansa... - Septa.

518
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:54,310
现在你变粗鲁了.
Now you are being rude.

519
00:41:00,016 --> 00:41:02,152
王子.
My prince.

520
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:06,422
王子.
My prince.

521
00:41:06,457 --> 00:41:08,058
小姐.
My Lady.

522
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:11,627
我恐怕表现得有些粗暴
I fear I have behaved monstrously

523
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:14,531
在过去的几周里.
the past few weeks.

524
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,701
可以吗?
With your permission?

525
00:41:31,112 --> 00:41:33,781
它很漂亮,
It's beautiful,

526
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:35,882
很象你母亲戴的那个.
like the one your mother wears.

527
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,884
有朝一日你将成为王后.
You'll be queen someday.

528
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:40,721
你必须打扮得象个王后.
It's only fitting you should look the part.

529
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:47,895
你能原谅我的粗鲁吗?
Will you forgive me for my rudeness?

530
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:50,866
没什么要原谅的.
There's nothing to forgive.

531
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:55,272
你是我亲爱的小姐.
You're My Lady.

532
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:58,475
有朝一日我们会在朝堂上举行婚礼.
One day we'll be married in the throne room.

533
00:41:58,509 --> 00:42:02,444
七国各地的领主和夫人们都会赶来,
Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come,

534
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,746
从最北端城堡
from the last hearth in the North

535
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:07,716
到最南端的海滨,
to the Salt Shore in the South,

536
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,987
你将是他们最高贵的王后.
and you will be Queen over all of them.

537
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:16,658
<i>我永远不会再对你无礼.
I'll never disrespect you again.</i>

538
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:19,895
我也永远不会再对你粗暴.
I'll never be cruel to you again.

539
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:22,230
你明白吗?
Do you understand me?

540
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:26,301
你是我亲爱的小姐,
You're My Lady now,

541
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,772
从今天开始
from this day

542
00:42:29,806 --> 00:42:32,574
直到我生命的最后一天.
until my last day.

543
00:42:54,665 --> 00:42:56,766
停下.
Stop.

544
00:42:56,801 --> 00:42:59,370
- 停下! - 哦哇.
- Stop! - Whoa.

545
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:03,306
- 你在干什么? - 去君临.
- What are you doing? - Going to King's Landing.

546
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:05,442
乘一辆运芜菁的车子?
In a turnip cart?

547
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:08,478
我会在白港找一条去南方的船.
I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.

548
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,346
你付得起船钱吗?
And you can afford that?

549
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:14,082
我的一些朋友比另一些慷慨.
Some of my friends are more generous than others.

550
00:43:14,116 --> 00:43:16,785
君临有上千象你这样的姑娘.
There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.

551
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:19,087
那我会有很多同伴.
So I'll have lots of company.

552
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:20,823
是的, 你会很受欢迎...
Yes, you'll be very popular...

553
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:22,558
直到哪一天某个肥胖的领主光临
Until some fat lord comes to visit

554
00:43:22,592 --> 00:43:24,460
肚子很大而那话儿很小
with a big belly and a little prick

555
00:43:24,495 --> 00:43:26,996
因为你伺候得他不满意, 把你打得满地找牙.
and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.

556
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:29,899
我留在这里会怎样?
And what will happen to me if I stay here?

557
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:31,868
我会成为葛雷乔伊夫人吗,
Will I become Lady Greyjoy,

558
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:34,973
- 会成为铁群岛的女主人吗? - 别傻了.
- mistress of the Iron Islands? - Don't be a fool.

559
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,141
我听说詹姆兰尼斯特攻击了史塔克大人
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark

560
00:43:37,176 --> 00:43:38,942
就在君临城的大街上.
in the streets of King's Landing.

561
00:43:38,978 --> 00:43:42,846
很快方圆百里的所有男人都将从军南下
Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon

562
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:44,848
他们多数永远都不会再回来.
and most of them will never come back.

563
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:46,884
这儿没我什么事了.
There's nothing left for me here.

564
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:50,219
我们走吧, 斯特芬.
Let's go, Stefon.

565
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,721
<i>走喽.
Giddyup.</i>

566
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,022
让我再看一眼!
Let me see it one more time!

567
00:43:54,056 --> 00:43:56,357
看什么?
See what?

568
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,870
我会想念你的.
I'm going to miss you.

569
00:44:09,906 --> 00:44:11,772
我知道.
I know.

570
00:44:25,553 --> 00:44:27,587
我要送你们俩回临冬城.
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

571
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:29,022
- 什么?! - 听我说...
- What?! - Listen...

572
00:44:29,056 --> 00:44:31,658
- 乔佛里的事怎么办? - 因为你的腿伤好不了吗?
- What about Joffrey? - Are you dying because of your leg?

573
00:44:31,692 --> 00:44:32,971
<i>所以你要送我们回家?
Is that why you're sending us home?</i>

574
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:34,160
什么? 不是.
What? No.

575
00:44:34,161 --> 00:44:35,594
求你了, 父亲. 不要.
Please, father. Please don't.

576
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:37,797
不可以. 我要跟西利欧上课.
You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio.

577
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,431
我一定会表现好的.
I'm finally getting good.

578
00:44:39,466 --> 00:44:41,900
这不是在惩罚你们.
This isn't a punishment.

579
00:44:41,935 --> 00:44:44,337
我让你们回临冬城是为你们的安全着想.
I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.

580
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,804
我们可以带西利欧一起走吗?
Can we take Syrio back with us?

581
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,411
谁管你的笨舞蹈老师啊?
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher?

582
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,736
我不能走.
I can't go.

583
00:44:48,743 --> 00:44:50,611
我是要嫁给乔佛里王子的.
I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.

584
00:44:50,645 --> 00:44:52,547
我爱他, 我要做他的王后
I love him and I'm meant to be his Queen

585
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,183
- 为他生孩子. - 七层地狱啊.
- and have his babies. - Seven hells.

586
00:44:55,216 --> 00:44:56,850
等你再大点,
When you're old enough,

587
00:44:56,884 --> 00:44:59,587
我会给你找个配得上你的人,
I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you,

588
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:02,290

[She sighs]

3
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,723
And eat.

4
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,771
lsn't there anything else?

5
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:30,943
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.

6
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,277
People can't live on grass.

7
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,914
[Jorah] In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,

8
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,376
they say there are fields of ghost grass

9
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,711
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

10
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,257
lt murders all other grass.

11
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,800
The Dothraki believe that one day

12
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,012
it will cover everything -
that's the way the world will end.

13
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,861
lt'll get easier.

14
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,413
[Neighs, snorts]

15
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,674
[Laughing]

16
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,609
Khaleesi!

17
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,569
Your hands.

18
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,123
We're still not far from Pentos,
Your Grace.

19
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,627
Master Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

20
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,419
You'd be more comfortable there.

21
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,298
l have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

22
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,677
l'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end
of the bargain and l have my crown.

23
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,055
As you wish, Your Grace.

24
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,432
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

25
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,726
l suppose it is preferable to beheading.

26
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,396
What did Ned Stark want you for?

27
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,651
Buying from a slaver?

28
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,735
Selling to one.

29
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,779
Some poachers l caught on my land.

30
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:45,284
Under my reign, you won't be punished
for such nonsense.

31
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,245
You can rest assured of that.

32
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,379
[Dogs howling]

- [Moans]
- [Barking]

35
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,523
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

36
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,362
My mother's been looking for you.

37
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,615
We ride for King's Landing today.

38
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,742
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

39
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,161
and omer your sympathies.

40
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,706
What good will my sympathies do them?

41
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:36,420
None. But it is expected of you.

42
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,463
Your absence has already been noted.

43
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,548
The boy means nothing to me.

44
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,009
And l can't stand
the wailing of women.

45
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,178
[Whimpers]

46
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,139
One word and l'll hit you again.

47
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,848
l'm telling Mother!

48
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,310
Go! Tell her.

49
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:54,521
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark

50
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,564
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

51
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,483
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

52
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,821
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

53
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,115
You can't...

54
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,699
Do you understand?

55
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,750
The Prince will
remember that, little lord.

56
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,793
l hope so.

57
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,214
lf he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

58
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:27,137
Ah. Time for breakfast.

59
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,314
Bread. And two of those little fish.

60
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,733
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

61
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,404
And bacon, burnt black.

62
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,406
- Hyah.
- [Laughs]

63
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,369

ls Bran going to die?

65

Apparently not.

66
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,468
- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.

67
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,646
lt's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

68
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,480
Only the gods know for certain.

69
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,024
All the rest of us can do is pray.

70
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:26,071
The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.

71
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,865
l still can't believe you're going.

72
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,033
lt's ridiculous, even for you.

73
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,869
Where's your sense of wonder?

74
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:36,081
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,

75

the wintry abode of the white walkers.

76
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,670
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

77
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,673
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

78
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,675
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

79
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,886
No, l just want to stand
on top of the Wall

80
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,803
and piss off the edge of the world.

81
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,891
The children don't need to hear your filth.

82
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,519
Come.

83
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,362
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

84
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,949
Give me a good, clean death any day.

85
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,829
Speaking for the grotesques,
l'd have to disagree.

86
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,665
Death is so final, whereas life...

87
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,000
ah, life is full of possibilities.

88
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,589
l hope the boy does wake. l'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.

90
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,804

whose side you're on.

My dear brother, you wound me.

92
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,601
You know how much
l love my family.

93
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,206
Please.

94
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,583
Oh, l would have dressed, Your Grace.

95
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,044
This is your home. l'm your guest.

96
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,424
Handsome one, isn't he?

97
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:15,639

a little black-haired beauty.

98
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,599
He was a fighter too -

100
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,980
Forgive me.

101
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,941
lt's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

102
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,110
l never knew.

103
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,111
lt was years ago.

104
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,075

beat his hands bloody on the wall,

105
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,578
all the things men do
to show you how much they care.

106
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,586
The boy looked just like him.

107
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,088
Such a little thing.

108
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,301

109
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,471
They came to take his body away

110
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:02,186
and Robert held me.
l screamed and l battled, but he held me.

111
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,275
That little bundle.

112
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,488
They took him away
and l never saw him again.

113
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,865
Never have visited the crypt, never.

every morning and night

115

116
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,634
l am grateful.

117
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,596

[Bellows pumping, fire crackling]

00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,732

- l already have one.
- Good man.

- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course l have.

At someone, l mean.

123
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:48,500
lt's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

124

You realise we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,

125
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,715
and some bone to keep it all standing.

126
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,052
Let me thank you ahead of time

127
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,929
for guarding us all from the perils
beyond the Wall -

and whatnot.

129
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,813
We're grateful to have good, strong men
like you protecting us.

Soon enough.

134
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,458
Give my regards to the Night's Watch.

135
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,629

in such an elite force. And if not...

it's only for life.

137

My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

Close the door.

This is no toy.

152
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,466
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

153
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,431
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

154
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,600
l had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

155
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,976
lt won't hack a man's head off,

156
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,979
but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.

157

- l can be quick.
- You'll have to work at it every day.

l think so.

161
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,368
First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.

162

l know which end to use.

163
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,961

Careful.

165
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,102
All the best swords have names, you know.

l've got a needle of my own.

168
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,921
l came to say goodbye to Bran.

169
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,630
You've said it.

170
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,352
l wish l could be here when you wake up.

171
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,192
l'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

l know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

174

at Castle Black when you're better.

175

l'll know my way around by then.

176
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,258
l'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

177
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,349
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.

178
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,908
l want you...

179
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,701
to leave.

180
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,971
1T years ago

181
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,516
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

182
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,063
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

183
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,317
And now you're leaving again.

184
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,697
l have no choice.

185
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:55,741
That's what men always say
when honour calls.

186
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,203
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

187
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,165
You do have a choice.

188
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,877
And you've made it.

189
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,967
Cat...

190
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,516
l can't do it, Ned.

191
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,438
l really can't.

192
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,022
You can.

193
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,734
You must.

194
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,052
You've said goodbye to Bran?

195
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,180
He's not going to die. l know it.

196
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,473
You Starks are hard to kill.

197
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,018
My mother?

198
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,686
- She was very kind.
- Good.

199
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,650
Next time l see you,
you'll be all in black.

200
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,902
lt was always my colour.

201
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,863
Farewell, Snow.

202
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,615
And you, Stark.

203
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,170
There's great honour serving
in the Night's Watch.

204
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,799
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

205
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,720
And you are a Stark.

206
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,930
You might not have my name,

207
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,057
but you have my blood.

208
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,691
ls my mother alive?

209
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,987
Does she know about me?
Where l am, where l'm going?

210
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,698
Does she care?

211
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,993
I
The next time we see each other

212
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,121
we'll talk about your mother.

213
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,039
Hmm?

214
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,625
l promise.

215
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,784
[Horse neighs]

216
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,209
Gods, this is country!

217
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:37,463
l've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

218
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,969
l've half a mind to go with you.

219
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:46,765
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

220
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,227
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

221
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,020
- You should have asked me 20 years ago.
- [Chuckles]

222
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,898
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

223
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,277
we never had the chance to be young.

224
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,028
l recall a few chances.

225
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,321
[Laughing]

226
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,535
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

227
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,578
That common girl of yours?

228
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,498
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

229
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,791
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

230
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,587
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.

231
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,338
And her tits.

232
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,800
Yours was, er... Aleena?

233
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,804
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?

234
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,847
Your bastard's mother?

235
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,852
- Wylla.
- That's it.

236
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,020
She must have been a rare wench

237
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:37,065
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honour.

238
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,233
You never told me what she looked like.

239
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,528
Nor will l.

240
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,032
We were at war.

241
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,911
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

242
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,079
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

243
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,251
l swear if l weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

244
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,713
The worst thing about your coronation -

245
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,840
l'll never get to hit you again.

246
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,637
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

247
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,644
There was a rider in the night.

248
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:23,237
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

249
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,196
What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

250
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,615
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

251
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,742
and a bold man to wield it.

252
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,662
She's little more than a child.

253
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,998
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

254
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,794
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

255
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,213
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

256
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,633
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

257
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,759
the woman l loved.

258
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,930
l'll kill every Targaryen l get my hands on.

259
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,973
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

260
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,726
This Khal Drogo,

261
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,728
it's said he has 100,OOO men
in his horde.

262
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,605
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

263
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,317
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

264
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,403
They have no ships, Robert.

265
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,489
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

266
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,326
lf the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

267
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,079
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

268
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:19,960
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

269
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,049
There's a war coming, Ned.

270
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,305
l don't know when,
l don't know who we'll be fighting,

271
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,890
but it's coming.

272
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,144
[Laughter]

273
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,541
[Whimpering]

274
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,962
[Grunting]

275
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,498
[Fox barking]

276
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,712
Sit.

277
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,589
You'll be fed.

278
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:54,346
Untie them.

279
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,723
Ah, rapers.

280
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:03,689
They were given a choice, no doubt -
castration or the Wall.

281
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,066
Most choose the knife.

282
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:13,615
Not impressed by your new brothers?

283
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,327
Lovely thing about the Watch -

284
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:21,789
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

285
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,675
Why do you read so much?

286
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,929
Look at me and tell me what you see.

287
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,141
ls this a trick?

288
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,978
What you see is a dwarf.

289
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:46,272
lf l'd been born a peasant they might've
Ieft me out in the woods to die.

290
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:50,484
Alas, l was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

291
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,613
Things are expected of me.

292
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:55,156
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

293
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,284
Until your brother killed that king.

294
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,835
Yes, until my brother killed him.

295
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,381
Life is full of these little ironies.

296
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:15,176
My sister married the new king, and...

297
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,762
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

298
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:23,602
l must do my part for the honour of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

299
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,314
But how?

300
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,233
Well, my brother has his sword

301
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,609
and l have my mind,

302
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:35,780
and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

303
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,534
That's why l read so much, Jon Snow.

304
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,455
And you?

305
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,750
What's your story, bastard?

306
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,922
Ask me nicely
and maybe l'll tell you, dwarf.

307
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,720
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

308
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:03,307
off to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,

309
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:07,229
alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

310
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,980
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

311
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:12,401
Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

312
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:16,070
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

313
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,448
You're a smart boy.

314
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:21,034
You don't believe that nonsense.

315
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,461
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

316
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,726
[Wind howling]

317
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,935
[Creak]

318
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:10,083
lt's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

319
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:14,003
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

320
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,508
Talk to Poole about it.

321
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,721
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

322
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,390
We need a new steward,

323
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:28,559
and there are several other
appointments that require

324
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:32,564
- our immediate attention.
- l don't care about appointments!

325
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:33,731
[Footsteps]

326
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,817
l'll make the appointments.

327
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:40,572
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

328
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,699
Very good, my lord.

329
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,452
My lady.

330
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,663
[Distant howling]

331
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:56,672
[Distant barking, howling]

332
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,759
When was the last time you left this room?

333
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:04,387
l have to take care of him.

334
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:06,222
He's not going to die, Mother.

335
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,141
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

336
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,308
What if he's wrong?

337
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:12,813
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

338
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,648
- He's six.
- [Barking and howling continues]

339
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,986
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

340
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,445
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!

341
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:23,574
l can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

342
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,742
- [Howling, barking]
- [Animal shrieking]

343
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,912
Fire.

344
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,207
- [People shouting]
- You stay here. l'll come back.

345
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,625
[Bell ringing]

346
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,378
[Barking, people shouting]

347
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:52,435
You're not supposed to be here.

348
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,146
No one is supposed to be here.

349
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,566
lt's a mercy.

350
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,526
He's dead already.

351
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:02,988
No!

352
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,698

[Animals bleating]

363
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:13,808
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

364
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,811
Everywhere? Even in the East?

365
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:19,897
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

366
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,942
- It is known.
- It is known.

367
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:26,946
A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

368
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:29,199
The moon?

369
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,951
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

370
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:34,663
that once there were two moons in the sky.

371
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:38,709
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,

372
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,795
and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

373
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:43,755
and they drank the sun's fire.

374
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,842
[Chuckles] Moon is no egg.

375
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,720
Moon is goddess - wife of sun.

376
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,346
- It is known.
- It is known.

377
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:55,808
Leave me with her.

378
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:07,695
Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?

379
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,324
Men like to talk when they're happy.

380
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:14,493
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

381
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,872
How old were you?

382
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,499
l was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.

383
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,210
Nine?!

384
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:25,255
l did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

385
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,217
First you must learn.

386
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,556
Can you teach me
how to make the khal happy?

387
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:37,768
Yes.

388
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:39,603
Will it take three years?

389
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,730
No.

390
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:48,612

Welcome.

393
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:40,306
[Catelyn] What l am about to tell you
must remain between us.

394
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:44,393
l don't think Bran fell from that tower.

395
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:47,606
l think he was thrown.

396
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,735
The boy was always
surefooted before.

397
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,695
Someone tried to kill him twice.

398
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,657
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

399
00:35:57,782 --> 00:36:00,452
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

400
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:03,204
- Saw what, my lady?
- l don't know.

401
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:07,083
But l would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

402
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,461
We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.

403
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:12,797
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

404
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,217
lt's too fine a weapon for such a man.

405
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,594
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

406
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,514
Someone gave it to him.

407
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:25,561
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

408
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,186
lf it's war they want...

409
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,438
lf it comes to that,
you know l'll stand behind you.

410
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:32,693
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

411
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,318
Hmm?

412
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:37,405
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

413
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,532
We don't know the truth yet.

414
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,994
Lord Stark must be told of this.

415
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,913
l don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

416
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:46,914
- l'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

417
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:50,210
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

418
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:52,170
- l will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

419
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,797
l must.

420
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:57,467
l'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

421
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:00,094
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

422
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:02,347
l don't want the Lannisters
to know l'm coming.

423
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,974
Let me accompany you at least.

424
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,101
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place
for a woman alone.

425
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,275
What about Bran?

426
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:17,820
l have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

427
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:22,409
Bran's life is in their hands now.

428
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,262
No, Khaleesi.

429
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:26,222
You must look in his eyes always.

430
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,432
Love comes in at the eyes.

431
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:32,855
lt is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

432
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:34,815
with nothing but her eyes.

433
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:37,108
Finish a man?

434
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,903
Oh.

435
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:45,617
Kings travelled across the world
for a night with Irogenia.

436
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:48,369
Magisters sold their palaces.

437
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:51,914
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

438
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,585
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

439
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:58,755
and she refused them all.

440
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,092
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

441
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,885
l... l don't think

442
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,471
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

443
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,849
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

444
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:10,976
Men want what they've never had.

445
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:14,478
And the Dothraki take slaves like
a hound takes a bitch.

446
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,858
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

447
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,329
Then don't make love like a slave.

448
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,340
[Gasps] Very good, Khaleesi.

449
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,467
Out there he is the mighty khal,

450
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:48,472
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

451
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:50,681
l... l don't think

452
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:53,309
that this is the Dothraki way.

453
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,478
lf he wanted the Dothraki way,

454
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:58,398
why did he marry you?

455
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:48,239
No.

456
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,661

Do l frighten you so much, girl?

461
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:57,786
Or is it him there making you shake?

462
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,329
He frightens me too.

463
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:02,958

l'm sorry if l offended you, ser.

465
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:13,427
Why won't he speak to me?

466
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:16,512
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

467
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:19,641
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

468
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:22,518
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

Does the hound frighten you?

Away with you, dog.

00:47:00,903 --> 00:47:02,989
Go on. Run.

529
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:08,244
Go! Leave now!

530
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:12,791
- It's a direwolf.
- l'll check down here.

531
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,967
- [Whines]
- [Man] l think l heard a noise.

532
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:25,137
Go!

533
00:47:37,356 --> 00:47:39,943
- [Dogs barking]
- [Ned] Arya!

534
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:42,278
[Man] Arya!

535
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:44,947
[Ned] Arya!

536
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:47,951
[Man] Arya!

537
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:50,621
Arya!

538
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:52,956
[Man] Arya!

539
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:55,166
My lord!

540
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,335
My Lord! They've found her.

541
00:47:57,376 --> 00:47:59,963
- She's unharmed.
- [Man] Arya!

542
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,382
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

543
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:04,342
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

544
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:06,552
- [Man] Arya!
- Right, get back.

545
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:09,347
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

546
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,682
Back! Back to the inn!

547
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:14,436
All back!

548
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:24,112
l'm sorry, l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

549
00:48:24,237 --> 00:48:25,739
- Are you hurt?
- No.

550
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:28,324
Oh, it's all right.

551
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:32,788
What is the meaning of this?

552
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:34,956
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

553
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:36,833
How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?

554
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:38,376
Quiet, woman.

555
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:42,630
Sorry, Ned. l never meant to frighten the girl.

556
00:48:42,713 --> 00:48:45,092
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

557
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,846
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

558
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:51,139
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

559
00:48:51,222 --> 00:48:53,141
That's not true!

560
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:55,811
She just... bit him a little.

561
00:48:56,644 --> 00:48:59,313
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

562
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:02,608
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

563
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:04,277
That's not what happened!

564
00:49:04,402 --> 00:49:07,530
Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

565
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:08,824
- Liar!
- Shut up!

566
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:10,367
[Robert] Enough!

567
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:13,411
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

568
00:49:13,452 --> 00:49:15,746
Seven hells!
What am l to make of this?

569
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,710
- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed, asleep.

570
00:49:20,793 --> 00:49:22,838
She's not.

571
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,382
Sansa, come here, darling.

572
00:49:28,552 --> 00:49:30,554
[Murmuring]

573
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:38,228
Now, child...

574
00:49:39,228 --> 00:49:41,190
tell me what happened.

575
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:43,358
Tell it all and tell it true.

576
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:45,943
lt's a great crime to lie to a king.

577
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:56,621
l don't know.

578
00:49:56,746 --> 00:49:59,750
l don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

579
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:03,211
- l didn't see.
- Liar!

580
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:04,755
- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!

581
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,132
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!

582
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:10,719
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

583
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,846
- l want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

584
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:14,431
whip her through the streets?

585
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:17,601
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

586
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:20,353
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

587
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:25,442
You let that little girl disarm you?

588
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:34,617
Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.

589
00:50:34,742 --> 00:50:37,538
- l'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

590
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:40,748
[Cersei] And what of the direwolf?

591
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,960
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

592
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:49,423
l'd forgot the damned wolf.

593
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:52,177
I
We found no trace of the direwolf
Your Grace.

594
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:55,514
No? So be it.

595
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:57,682
We have another wolf.

596
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:02,688
As you will.

597
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:06,065
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolfs no pet.

598
00:51:06,148 --> 00:51:08,360
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

599
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:12,197
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

600
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,907
No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

601
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:17,119
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

602
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:20,163
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

603
00:51:20,246 --> 00:51:22,708
Please, please, it wasn't Lady!

604
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:24,543
ls this your command?

605
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,128
Your Grace?

606
00:51:32,675 --> 00:51:33,677
[Door slams]

607
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:37,097
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

608
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:39,182
Ser Ilyn, do me the honour.

609
00:51:39,307 --> 00:51:40,726
No.

610
00:51:41,684 --> 00:51:43,728
Jory...

611
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:47,231
take the girls to their rooms.

612
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:53,947
- [Sansa sobbing]
- If it must be done,

613
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,032
then l'll do it myself.

614
00:51:56,115 --> 00:51:58,202
ls this some trick?

615
00:51:58,284 --> 00:52:00,369
The wolf is of the North.

616
00:52:01,871 --> 00:52:04,333
She deserves better than a butcher.

617
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:41,369
The butcher's boy -
you rode him down?

618
00:52:41,494 --> 00:52:43,496
He ran.

619
00:52:43,621 --> 00:52:45,206
Not very fast.

620
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:04,934
[Whines]

621
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:18,739
[Whines]

622
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:34,005
[Whimpers]

623
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,556
[Soft groaning]

624
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:55,360
[Lady whines]

625
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:57,820
[lnhales]

626
00:53:57,945 --> 00:53:59,989
[Lady yelps]

627
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:14,989

1
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,305
[Breathing]

2
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,986
[Varys] You've seen better days, my lord.

3
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:13,282
Another visit?

4
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:17,036
lt seems you're my last friend.

5
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,996
No, no, many still love you.

6
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:25,377
Sansa came to court this morning
to plead for your life.

7
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:29,256
On her knees begging for me. Hm!

8
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:31,508
Did you laugh with the others?

9
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:35,221
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing l want.

10
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:37,223
l don't know what you want.

11
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:38,973
l've given up trying to guess.

12
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:44,604
When l was still a boy -

13
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,483
before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -

14
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:52,071
l travelled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

15
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:56,699
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

16
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:59,578
The same is true at court.

17
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:01,955
l am the master of whisperers.

18
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:06,460
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

19
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:08,545
l'm a good actor, my lord.

20
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,924
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

21
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:14,050
l could.

22
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:15,510
But will l?

23
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,972
- No.
- [Laughs]

24
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,056
As l said, l'm no hero.

25
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:21,933
What do you want? Tell me.

26
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:24,894
No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want?

27
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,607
Peace.

28
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:34,780
Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.

29
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,240
Fighting for his father's freedom.

30
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:39,534
Robb?

31
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,453
He's just a boy.

32
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:43,788
Boys have been conquerors before.

33
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:50,461
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.

34
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:53,340
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.

35
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:56,634
He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

36
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,139
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.

37
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:02,807
[Varys tuts]

38
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:07,979
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.

39
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,609
Cersei is no fool.

40
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:15,028
She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.

41
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:18,699
You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men,

42
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:20,408
who crippled my son?

43
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,452
l want you to serve the realm!

44
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:25,288
Tell the queen you will confess
your vile treason,

45
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:27,415
tell your son to lay down his sword

46
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:30,711
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

47
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:35,798
Cersei knows you as a man of honour.

48
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,678
lf you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

49
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:43,389
l believe she will allow you
to take the black

50
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:47,019
and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

51
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:48,437
[Chuckles]

52
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:51,065
You think my life
is some precious thing to me?

53
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:55,903
That l would trade my honour
for a few more years of...

54
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:57,655
Of what?

55
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:04,620
You grew up with actors.

56
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:09,083
You learned their craft and you learnt it well.

57
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,545
But l grew up with soldiers.

58
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:17,007
l learned how to die a long time ago.

59
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:21,803
Pity.

60
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:24,764
Such a pity.

61
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:34,024
What of your daughter's life, my lord?

62
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:36,569
ls that a precious thing to you?

63
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:42,533
[Water dripping]

64
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,084
[Cawing]

65
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:00,550
[Arrow whooshes]

66
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,904
lt's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

67
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:24,783
- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
- [Catelyn] Keep shooting them down.

68
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:27,911
We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.

69
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:31,040
He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

70
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:34,918
[Greatjon] Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

71
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:36,211
Look.

72
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,173
[Robb] Father rots in a dungeon.

73
00:06:40,257 --> 00:06:42,384
How long before they take his head?

74
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:45,512
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

75
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:48,098
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

76
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:51,142
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

77
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:54,646
[Greatjon] Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

78
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,440
The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,

79
00:06:57,524 --> 00:07:00,694
and for 600 years
they have never failed to exact their toll.

80
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,029
Have my horse saddled and ready.

81
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:06,283
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he likes.

82
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:09,202
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

83
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,959
My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,336
Whatever it took.

85
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:22,007
lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

86
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:23,300
l agree.

87
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:26,512
- l'll go.
- [Theon] You can't!

88
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:30,932
l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl.
He would never harm me.

89
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:33,476
[Greatjon] Unless there was a profit in it.

90
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,026
What do you want?

91
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:44,738
lt is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.

92
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,574
Oh, spare me.

93
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:50,786
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

94
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:52,913
What am l supposed to do with you?

95
00:07:52,997 --> 00:07:56,040
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...

96
00:07:56,125 --> 00:08:02,214
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until l die. Do l look dead to you?

97
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,093
- Father, please...
- l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

98
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:11,639
Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.

99
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:18,187
All right, you come forward.

100
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:29,867
[Smacking kiss]

101
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,368
There.
Now that l've observed the courtesies,

102
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:35,872
perhaps my sons will do me the honour
of shutting their mouths.

103
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:43,214
ls there somewhere we can talk?

104
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,382
We're talking right now.

105
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,930
Fine.

106
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:53,598
Out! All of you!

107
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,319
- Oh!
- You too.

108
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,869
You see that?

109
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,039
Fifteen, she is.

110
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,958
A little flower.

111
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:23,503
And her honey's all mine. [Chuckles]

112
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:28,258
l'm sure she will give you many sons.

113
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,012
Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.

114
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,055
He is quite ill, my lord.

115
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,226
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

116
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,603
Or the one before that.

117
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:43,232
Your family has always pissed on me.

118
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:46,234
- My lord, l...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

119
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:50,781
The fine Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.

120
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,784
- l'm sure there were reasons...
- l didn't need reasons.

121
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:58,622
l needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

122
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:04,169
Why are you here?

123
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,839
To ask you...

124
00:10:07,964 --> 00:10:10,217
to open your gates, my lord...

125
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:14,847
so my son and his bannermen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.

126
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:18,016
- Why should l let him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

127
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:21,645
you would see that he has
20,OOO men outside your walls.

128
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,148
They'll be 20,OOO corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

129
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:27,568
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

130
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:30,112
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

131
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:33,073
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

132
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:35,492
You swore an oath to my father.

133
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:38,704
Oh, yes, l said some words.

134
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:41,998
And l swore oaths to the crown too,
if l remember right.

135
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,376
Joffrey's king now,

136
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:49,131
which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

137
00:10:50,965 --> 00:10:55,054
lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish,
l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

138
00:10:55,137 --> 00:11:00,059
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

139
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:05,940
Give me one good reason why l should
waste a single thought on any of you?

140
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,733
- [Man] And...engage!
- [Wind howls]

141
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:10,944
[Door slams]

142
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:14,073
When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?

143
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:16,367
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

144
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,204
You'll be ready for this, then.

145
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:25,041
l thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...

146
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:29,588
so l had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

147
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,383
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.

148
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:46,063
This is Valyrian steel.

149
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:51,734
lt was my father's sword,
his father before him.

150
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:55,281
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

151
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:57,407
lt was meant for my son Jorah.

152
00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:03,247
He brought dishonour to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

153
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:05,583
before he fled from Westeros.

154
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,752
- My lord, you honour me, but l can't...
- Oh, you can.

155
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,589
And you will.

156
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:15,593
l wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.

157
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:18,429
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

158
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:24,142
So you'll take it.
l'll hear no more about it.

159
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:26,978
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.

160
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:28,646
Right.

161
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:34,652
Now, don't think this means l approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

162
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:38,281
That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

163
00:12:39,782 --> 00:12:41,618
l'll apologise to Ser Alliser tonight.

164
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:45,164
No, you won't.
l sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

165
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:49,292
The hand that your wolf tore off
that thing's wrist...

166
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:52,670
l've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this...

167
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:54,672
boy king.

168
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:57,635
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

169
00:12:58,593 --> 00:13:03,806
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.

170
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,517
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...

171
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:08,978
and bring me my supper.

172
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:10,689
Yes, my lord.

173
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:24,578
- Well done.
- Well done.

174
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,332
You earned that, Snow.

175
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,338
Well done.

176
00:13:38,758 --> 00:13:40,261
Go on, let's have a look.

177
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,680
- At what?
- [Grenn] The sword! Show us the sword.

178
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:45,723
[All] Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

179
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:49,060
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

180
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:50,688
[Laughter, cheering]

181
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:55,984
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

182
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,027
[Laughter, excited chatter]

183
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,991
Come on,
l want to have a look at it in the light.

184
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:06,871
[Pyp] Give it here!

185
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,872
What is it?

186
00:14:08,955 --> 00:14:10,999
- l...
- Look at its eyes.

187
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,667
- Give it.
- l can't.

188
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:15,253
You can't what?

189
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:16,546
l...

190
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,843
l'm really not supposed to say.

191
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:23,595
And yet you really want to say.

192
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,680
You want to say that...?

193
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:31,770
There was a raven.

194
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:33,771
l read the message to Maester Aemon.

195
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:38,026
lt's your brother Robb.

196
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:39,903
What?

197
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:41,571
What about him?

198
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,532
He's heading south.

199
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:46,451
To war.

200
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,498
All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.

201
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,920
l should be there.

202
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:59,589
l should be with him.

203
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,258
[Hoofbeats approaching]

204
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,732
lf we do that, they'll never get back across.

205
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:20,276
[Robb] Well?

206
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:22,070
What did he say?

207
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:25,741
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

208
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:30,787
- His men are yours, as well.
- [Greatjon] Huh.

209
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:34,666
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.

210
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:36,126
What does he want in return?

211
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:40,506
You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.

212
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,467
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.

213
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,095
And?

214
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:50,266
And Arya...

215
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:54,185
will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.

216
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,980
- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

217
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,194
And?

218
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:04,363
And...

219
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,657
when the fighting is done...

220
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:12,121
you will marry one of his daughters.

221
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:15,207
Whichever you prefer.

222
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,710
He has a number
he thinks will be...suitable.

223
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:20,713
l see.

224
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:24,883
- Did you get a look at his daughters?
- [Snickering]

225
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:26,385
l did.

226
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:28,845
And?

227
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:31,765
One was...

228
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:39,440
Do you consent?

229
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,151
- Can l refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.

230
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:48,324
Then l consent.

231
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:53,536
[Chuckles]

232
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,861
[Cawing]

233
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:36,330
Sam said you wanted to see me?

234
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,832
l did indeed.

235
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,919
Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.

236
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:50,593
Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch

237
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:53,764
take no wives and father no children?

238
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,557
No.

239
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:57,392
So they will not love.

240
00:17:58,268 --> 00:18:01,939
Love is the death of duty.

241
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:05,860
lf the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...

242
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:08,278
between honour on the one hand...

243
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:10,864
I
and those he loves on the other

244
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:12,240
what would he do?

245
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:17,453
He... He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

246
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,709
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,OOO.

247
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,420
Most of us are not so strong.

248
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:27,131
What is honour...

249
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:29,967
compared to a woman's love?

250
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:32,468
And what is duty...

251
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:36,140
against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?

252
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:38,601
Or a brother's smile?

253
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:44,480
Sam told you.

254
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:46,609
We're all human.

255
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:49,945
Oh, we all do our duty
when there's no cost to it.

256
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,823
Honour comes easy then.

257
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,408
Yet...

258
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,451
sooner or later...

259
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,495
in every man's life...

260
00:18:58,578 --> 00:19:01,623
there comes a day when it is not easy.

261
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,793
A day when he must choose.

262
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:08,671
And this is my day?

263
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:10,841
ls that what you're saying?

264
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:14,053
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

265
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,055
- l know.
- You do not know.

266
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,934
No one knows.

267
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:24,688
l may be a bastard,

268
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:27,315
but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

269
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,441
[Chuckles]

270
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:35,865
The gods were cruel
when they saw fit to test my vows.

271
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:37,992
They waited till l was old.

272
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:43,498
What could l do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

273
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,043
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

274
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:48,045
l was helpless...

275
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,465
blind, frail.

276
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,218
But...

277
00:19:55,343 --> 00:19:58,805
when l heard they had
killed my brother's son...

278
00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:00,975
and his poor son...

279
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:02,517
and the children!

280
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:04,937
Even the little children.

281
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,690
Who are you?

282
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:14,613
My father was Maekar,

283
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:16,824
the first of his name.

284
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:21,202
My brother Aegon reigned after him...

285
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,163
when l had refused the throne.

286
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:27,709
And he was followed by his son Aerys...

287
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,754
whom they called the Mad King.

288
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:32,506
You're Aemon Targaryen.

289
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:37,303
l'm a maester of the Citadel,

290
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:41,599
bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

291
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:48,647
l will not tell you...to stay or go.

292
00:20:49,606 --> 00:20:52,317
You must make that choice yourself...

293
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:55,653
and live with it for the rest of your days.

294
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,659
As l have.

295
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:22,139
[Speaks Dothraki] *Khal anni...*
My lord...

296
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:24,766
[Speaks Dothraki] *Shekh ma shieraki anni...*
My sun and stars...

297
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:28,938
Drogo.

298
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:32,274
[Mutters]

299
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:34,026
[Grunts]

300
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:38,655
[Speaks Dothraki] *Sajo anni.*
My Horse.

301
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,991
[Speaks Dothraki] *Sajo... anni.*
My... Horse.

302
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:43,911
[Speaks Dothraki] *Qoy qoyi...*
Blood of my blood...

303
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:47,957
[Speaks Dothraki] *Vos, anha'th dothrak*
No, l must ride.

304
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:50,459
[Qotho speaks Dothraki] *Me arthas hrazefoon mae.*
He fell from his horse.

305
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:55,130
[Speaks Dothraki] *Khal fini laz vos dothrao, vos khal.*
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

306
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:58,383
[Speaks Dothraki] *Me haqa, vos ale. Me zigeree mithrat.*
He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest.

307
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:02,763
[Speaks Dothraki] *Kisha ray hezhahish chek asshekh. Kisha avimithreraki jinne.*
We've ridden far enough today. We will camp here.

308
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:05,056
[Speaks Dothraki] *Jinne vos gache vimithrerat.*
This is no place to camp.

309
00:22:05,181 --> 00:22:08,352
[Speaks Dothraki] *Chiori vos assoo kisha. Vos Khaleesi akka.*
A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.

310
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:12,480
[Speaks Dothraki] *Kisha avimithreraki jinne. Asti morea me Khal Drogo asso moon.*
We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

311
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,109
[Speaks Dothraki] *Shafka vos assoo anna zhey Khaleesi.*
You do not command me Khaleesi.

312
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:18,320
[Speaks Dothraki] *Ezi Mirri Maaz Duur. Fichi mae anhaan.*
Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.

313
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:21,073
[Speaks Dothraki] *Maegi? Anha afichak shafkea nharees zhey Khaleesi.*
The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

314
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:26,953
[Speaks Dothraki] *Fichi mae anhaan ozisa che Khal Drogo achara kifindirgi yer ziganeso anhaan.*
Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you defied me.

315
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:35,004
Hyah! Hyah!

316
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,445
[Kevan] Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins

317
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,905
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

318
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,533
They're a day's march north.

319
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:07,036
The boy may lack experience and sense,

320
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:09,622
but he does have a certain mindless...

321
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:13,292
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

322
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:18,922
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

323
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:21,424
l do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

324
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:23,593
otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

325
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:27,096
The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battle axes.

326
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:29,682
Heavy black steel, double-sided.

327
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:31,602
Shagga likes axes.

328
00:23:31,768 --> 00:23:36,440
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

329
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,107
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

330
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:40,861
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

331
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:43,322
[Kevan] They do seem rather ferocious.

332
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:47,617
[Tyrion] Ferocious?

333
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:52,456
Last night... a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

334
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:56,293
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.

335
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:59,045
Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping off the dead man's cock,

336
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:03,299
I
which was fortunate, but even still
Ulf is demanding blood money,

337
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:06,010
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

338
00:24:06,135 --> 00:24:09,265
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

339
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,892
Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war effort.

340
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:15,353
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

341
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,987
lt appears l'm not hungry after all.

342
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,654
Excuse me, my lords.

343
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:40,880
Where did you find one so pretty
at this hour?

344
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:43,132
- l took her.
- Took her?

345
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:46,302
- From whom?
- From, uh...

346
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,219
Ser... What's his name?

347
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:54,183
- l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

348
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:57,563
He said something.

349
00:25:00,024 --> 00:25:05,403
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

350
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:07,780
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

351
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,577
Oh, well. [Sighs]

352
00:25:13,996 --> 00:25:17,999
l, uh...
think l'll go and find myself one.

353
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,006
Who are you?

354
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,467
Who would you like me to be?

355
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:28,259
What did your mother call you?

356
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:31,471
Shae. What did your mother call you?

357
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,932
My mother died giving birth to me.

358
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:37,686
ls that why l'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

359
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,105
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

360
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:42,857
For...

361
00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:46,195
What do you want from me?

362
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:49,073
What do l want from you?

363
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:52,159
[Sighs] l want you to share my tent.

364
00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:55,246
l want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

365
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:57,914
rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.

366
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:02,085
l want you to take no other man to bed
for as long as we're together.

367
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:06,757
And l want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

368
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:08,883
Which it may well be.

369
00:26:08,968 --> 00:26:10,553
And what do l get?

370
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:12,263
One - safety.

371
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:16,432
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

372
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,228
Two - the pleasure of my company,

373
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,940
which l have heard is spectacular.

374
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:25,234
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

375
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:26,901
And three...

376
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:31,073
more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

377
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:35,035
Do you accept my proposal?

378
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,931
Let's start with your last night in this world.

379
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,411
[Muttering]

380
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:27,462
[Muttering]

381
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:31,299
[Jorah] Khaleesi.

382
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:32,426
Come.

383
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:36,971
He's very strong.

384
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,807
No one understands how strong he is.

385
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:56,574
[Daenerys gasps]

386
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,830
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

387
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:04,583
He can't. l won't let him.

388
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,795
Even a queen doesn't have that power.

389
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:13,926
We must go quickly.
l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

390
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:18,096
- l won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

391
00:28:18,221 --> 00:28:20,181
[Speaks Dothraki] *Rides...*
Doth...

392
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:22,016
Even if...

393
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,520
Even if he dies...

394
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,065
why would l run?

395
00:28:29,232 --> 00:28:33,778
l am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.

396
00:28:33,903 --> 00:28:37,032
This isn't Westeros, where men honour blood.

397
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:41,745
Here they only honour strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

398
00:28:41,871 --> 00:28:44,582
Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.

399
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:46,709
He won't want any rivals.

400
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:51,546
Your boy will be plucked from your breast
and given to the dogs.

401
00:28:52,672 --> 00:28:55,383
l won't... leave him.

402
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:07,103
The wound has festered.

403
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,190
[Speaks Dothraki] *Yer et jin zhey maegi.*
You did this witch.

404
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,109
[Speaks Dothraki] *Nakhi*
Stop it!

405
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:13,776
[Speaks Dothraki] *Anha vos zalok meme nem azzisa.*
l don't want her hurt.

406
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:19,074
[Speaks Dothraki] *Vos? Vos? Hash shafka vos zali meme nem azzisa?*
No? No? You don't want her hurt?

407
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:27,041
[Speaks Dothraki] *Zali mekisha vos azzisaki shafka akka. Shafka azh jin maegaan frakhat khales kishi.*
Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

408
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:30,794
[Jorah speaks Dothraki] *Javrathi lekh. Me zin Khaleesi shafki.*
Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.

409
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,713
[Qotho speaks Dothraki] *Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.*
Only while the blood of my blood lives.

410
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:41,680
[Speaks Dothraki] *Affin me drivoe, me vosi.*
When he dies, she is nothing.

411
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:52,775
[Speaks Dothraki] *Anha vosoon avvos. Anha qoy zhavvorsi.*
l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.

412
00:29:54,442 --> 00:30:00,282
[Speaks Dothraki] *Ei zhavvorsa drivi, zhey Khaleesi.*
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

413
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:10,334
l think you should wear
your armour tonight, ser.

414
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,128
l think you're right.

415
00:30:18,424 --> 00:30:22,345
- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.

416
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,681
He's beyond the healer's skills.

417
00:30:24,765 --> 00:30:27,183
All l can do is ease his path.

418
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:29,478
Save him and l will free you. l swear it.

419
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,690
You must know a way.

420
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:34,525
Some...

421
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:37,236
Some magic.

422
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:41,030
There is a spell.

423
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,410
Some would say death is cleaner.

424
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:56,005
Do it.

425
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:58,591
Save him.

426
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:01,509
- There is a price.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.

427
00:31:01,634 --> 00:31:03,888
lt's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.

428
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:06,015
Only death pays for life.

429
00:31:09,517 --> 00:31:11,061
My death?

430
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:13,939
No, not your death, Khaleesi.

431
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,317
Bring me his horse.

432
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:31,122
[Whinnying]

433
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:42,593
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

434
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:46,013
- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.

435
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:49,057
This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

436
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:52,769
l am your khaleesi.
l tell you what is forbidden.

438
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,489
Go. Now.

439
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:06,491
- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.

440
00:32:06,616 --> 00:32:07,785
Take her!

441

You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

442
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,256
The dead will dance here tonight.

What have you done?

448
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,509
l have to save him.

449
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:09,889
We could have been 10 miles
away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.

450
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:11,974
- You would have been safe.

No, you can't.

- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

- Just used to it.
- Drink.

[Tyrion] Let's play a new game.

478
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:22,854
There's a Braavosi knife game
l could teach you.

479
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:26,066
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

480
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,693
- Not if you win.
- No!

481
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:31,362
No fire games, no knife games.

- Let's do something l'm good at.
- What are you good at?

l happen to be a great judge of character.

484
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,664
- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

485
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:44,876
Here's how it works -
l make a statement about your past.

486
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:48,130
lf l'm right, you drink.
If l'm wrong, l drink.

487

And no lying.

Fine. Bronn first.

But my mother hit harder.

You killed your first man
before you were 12.

lt was a woman.

- Work.
- And...

498
00:36:34,677 --> 00:36:38,054
you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badly

499
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:39,974
so you've never let yourself love again.

500
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:44,144
Oh, wait, that's me.

501
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,191

All right.

507
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:15,717
Your father left the family when
you were very young, never to return.

508
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:16,968
Drink.

509
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,055
- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!

510
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:25,978
- [Bronn pours]
- Mm.

511
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,023
You wanted a different life.

512
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:32,860
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

513
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:35,653
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

514
00:37:35,695 --> 00:37:37,822
So, specifics...

515
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,452
You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

516
00:37:41,534 --> 00:37:45,331
l don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

517
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:49,126
So...what's a lowborn girl to do?

518
00:37:52,755 --> 00:37:54,005
Drink.

519
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:58,593
- Are you sure...
- Drink!

520
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:07,978
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,

521
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:10,606
or l will carve your eyes from your head.

522
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,987
My dear lady,
if l have offended you, l apologise.

523
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:20,115
My turn.

524
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:22,325
Fine, fine.

525
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,911
Ask away.

526
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:27,706
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

527
00:38:27,747 --> 00:38:30,751
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

528
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:33,211
l don't care the way the game works.

529
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:35,296
Our lord here used to be married.

530
00:38:36,257 --> 00:38:38,342
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

531
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:41,804
You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

532
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:45,932
Another night, perhaps.

533
00:38:47,101 --> 00:38:49,103
Not another night. This night.

534
00:38:50,646 --> 00:38:52,273
lt's not a pleasant story.

535
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:55,818
Oh, maybe l will cry.

536
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,447
l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more
unpleasant stories than your lordship.

537
00:39:02,615 --> 00:39:04,659
So...

538
00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:13,751
l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding,
when we heard a scream.

539
00:39:13,878 --> 00:39:18,382
She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.

540
00:39:18,465 --> 00:39:22,970
Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while l wrapped her in my cloak.

541
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:24,889
She was too scared to send off on her own,

542
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:29,976
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
l took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

543
00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:32,521
Her name was Tysha.

544
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:34,856
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

545
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,150
And she was hungry.

546
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:40,528
Together we finished off three chickens
and a flagon of wine.

547
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:44,825
lmpossible as it seems, there was a time
when l was unaccustomed to wine.

548
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:48,037
l forgot how afraid l was around girls...

549
00:39:48,162 --> 00:39:51,539
how l was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...

550
00:39:51,664 --> 00:39:52,874
look away embarrassed,

551
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,753
or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.

552
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:58,213
l forgot about everything but Tysha.

553
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:02,258
And somehow l found myself in her bed.

554
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:05,262
For three chickens, l should hope so.

555
00:40:05,345 --> 00:40:08,432
lt didn't last long.
l didn't know what the hell l was doing.

556
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:10,892
But she was good to me.

557
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:12,978
She kissed me afterwards and...

558
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,481
San9 me a SOn9.

559
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:20,610
And by morning
l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

560
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,988
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

561
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,242
and there you have it - man and wife.

562
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:32,289
For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.

563
00:40:32,372 --> 00:40:34,916
Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.

564
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:36,501
Not quite.

565
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,630
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

566
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:44,760
The girl was a whore, you see.

567
00:40:46,387 --> 00:40:51,474
Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers...all of it.

568
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,061
He thought it was time l had a woman.

569
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:58,231
After my brother confessed...

570
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,401
my father brought in my wife

571
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,445
and gave her to his guards.

572
00:41:04,947 --> 00:41:07,700
He paid her well -
a silver for each man.

573
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:10,702
How many whores command
that kind of price?

574
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:15,999
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

575
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:19,420
By the end, she had so much silver

576
00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:24,258
that the coins were slipping through her fingers
and rolling on to the floor.

577
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:31,139
l would have killed the man
who did that to me.

578
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,226
You should have known she was a whore.

579
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:36,144
Really?

580
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:39,523
l was 16, drunk and in love.

581
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:44,945
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.

582
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,617
As l said, l was young and stupid.

583
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,537
You are still young and stupid.

584
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,298
[Kissing]

585
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:13,974
[Galloping hoofbeats]

586
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:20,146
Hyah!

587
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:28,280
[Horse neighs]

588
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:31,075
[Distant shouting]

589
00:42:35,037 --> 00:42:36,621
[Clattering]

590
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:40,208
- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.

591
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:43,086
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

592
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,713
They're a mile north.

593
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:47,925
- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.

594
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:52,262
lf l die, weep for me.

595
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,599
You will be dead.
How will you know?

596
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:04,858
l'll know.

597
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,612
Watch out! Move!

598
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,365
Out of the way!

599
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:13,367
- Move aside!
- [Neighing]

600
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:21,291
Stay low.

601
00:43:22,293 --> 00:43:23,836
Stay low?

602
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:26,296
lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.

603
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,215
l was born lucky.

604
00:43:31,427 --> 00:43:33,762
Tribesmen of the Vale,

605
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,179
gather round!

606
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:39,309
Stone Crows!

607
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:41,604
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

608
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:44,356
- Moon Brothers!
- [Man] And Painted Dogs!

609
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:47,275
- And Painted Dogs!
- [Men] Painted Dogs!

610
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,278
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

611
00:43:50,403 --> 00:43:53,199
Onward, to claim what is yours!

612
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:55,409
Half man! Half man!

613
00:43:55,534 --> 00:43:58,871
[All] Half man! Half man!

614
00:43:58,954 --> 00:44:01,539
Half man! Half man!

615
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,541
To battle!

616
00:44:03,626 --> 00:44:04,918
[Yelling]

617
00:44:21,476 --> 00:44:23,436
[Horse neighing, echoes]

618
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:26,398
[Mumled shouts]

619
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,872
[Wagon rumbling]

620
00:44:46,126 --> 00:44:47,586
[Bronn] You're a shit warrior.

621
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,508
l'm alive?

622
00:44:53,467 --> 00:44:55,010
You're alive.

623
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,017
Did we win?

624
00:45:02,184 --> 00:45:04,811
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

625
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:06,688
[Screaming]

626
00:45:08,648 --> 00:45:10,900
[Blades slashing]
[Men screaming]

627
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:20,244
How did our tribesmen do?

628
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:23,831
Yeah, good.

629
00:45:24,874 --> 00:45:29,168
[Tyrion] It's nice to see them getting along.
[Tywin] You're wounded.

630
00:45:30,378 --> 00:45:32,298
Good of you to notice.

631
00:45:33,173 --> 00:45:34,465
l hear we won.

632
00:45:34,592 --> 00:45:37,135
Huh! The scouts were wrong.

633
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:40,889
There were 2,OOO Stark bannermen, not 20.

634
00:45:41,932 --> 00:45:44,101
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

635
00:45:44,184 --> 00:45:45,644
He wasn't here.

636
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,229
Where was he?

637
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,691
With his other 18,OOO men.

638
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:56,530
And where are they?

639
00:46:06,624 --> 00:46:08,583
- We should go, my lady.
- No!

640
00:46:13,923 --> 00:46:15,340
My lady!

641
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,762
- [Neighing]
- Hyah! Hyah!

642
00:46:48,874 --> 00:46:50,793
[Pants, grunts]

643
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:55,046
By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

644
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:02,512
Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword,
but l seem to have lost it.

645
00:47:02,637 --> 00:47:04,557
lt is not your sword l want.

646
00:47:06,016 --> 00:47:07,684
Give me my daughters back.

647
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:09,644
Give me my husband.

648
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:12,231
l've lost them too, l'm afraid.

649
00:47:12,356 --> 00:47:14,816
[Theon] Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

650
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,737
- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

651
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:22,907
[Catelyn] Take him away and put him in irons.

652
00:47:23,032 --> 00:47:25,536
We could end this war right now, boy,

653
00:47:25,661 --> 00:47:27,662
save thousands of lives.

654
00:47:27,787 --> 00:47:30,666
You fight for the Starks,
l fight for the Lannisters.

655
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:32,751
Swords or lances, teeth, nails -

656
00:47:32,876 --> 00:47:36,588
choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.

657
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,217
lf we do it your way, kingslayer...

658
00:47:42,302 --> 00:47:44,012
you'd win.

659
00:47:47,141 --> 00:47:48,684
We're not doing it your way.

660
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:52,438
[Greatjon] Come on, pretty man.

661
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:54,188
[Laughter, cheering]

662
00:48:01,362 --> 00:48:06,202
- l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

663
00:48:06,327 --> 00:48:09,329
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

664
00:48:16,336 --> 00:48:19,048
One victory does not make us conquerors.

665
00:48:20,883 --> 00:48:22,967
Did we free my father?

666
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:26,472
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

667
00:48:27,932 --> 00:48:31,559
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

668
00:48:37,023 --> 00:48:39,193
This war is far from over.

669
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,747
[Bell tolling]

670
00:49:10,516 --> 00:49:12,101
Could l have one?

671
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:14,019
A lemon one...or any of them.

672
00:49:14,103 --> 00:49:15,771
Three coppers.

673
00:49:16,563 --> 00:49:20,233
- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.

674
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:24,153
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

675
00:49:24,237 --> 00:49:25,780
Piss off!

676
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:35,164
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

677
00:49:35,249 --> 00:49:37,458
- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

678
00:49:37,584 --> 00:49:39,503
The Hand of the King.

679
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:16,706
[Crowd clamouring]

00:50:24,465 --> 00:50:25,633
[Jeering]

682
00:50:46,987 --> 00:50:49,155
- Traitor!
- Coward!

683
00:50:49,197 --> 00:50:51,282
[Ned mutters] Baelor.

684
00:50:51,367 --> 00:50:52,617
Baelor!

685
00:50:58,374 --> 00:51:01,043
Traitor! Traitor!

686
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:13,514
[Crowd quietens]

687
00:51:21,188 --> 00:51:23,356
l am Eddard Stark...

688
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,483
Lord of Winterfell...

689
00:51:25,568 --> 00:51:27,945
and Hand of the King.

690
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:39,622
l come before you to confess my treason...

691
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:42,709
in the sight of gods and men.

692
00:51:44,711 --> 00:51:46,380
l betrayed the faith of my king...

693
00:51:47,463 --> 00:51:49,508
and the trust of my friend Robert.

694
00:51:50,925 --> 00:51:53,387
l swore to protect and defend his children.

695
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:56,389
But before his blood was cold...

696
00:51:57,391 --> 00:52:00,184
l plotted to murder his son...

697
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:02,771
and seize the throne for myself.

698
00:52:02,896 --> 00:52:04,273
[Jeering, clamouring]

699
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:19,079
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what l say...

700
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:24,209
Joffrey Baratheon...

701
00:52:25,043 --> 00:52:27,463
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne...

702
00:52:28,171 --> 00:52:30,965
by the grace of all the gods,

703
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,343
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms...

704
00:52:33,427 --> 00:52:35,595
and Protector of the Realm.

705
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,847
[Crowd jeering]

706
00:52:36,972 --> 00:52:38,264
[Gasps]

707
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:44,979
As... As we sin...

708
00:52:45,813 --> 00:52:47,483
so do we sumer.

709
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:50,653
This man has confessed his crimes...

710
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:53,238
in sight of gods and men.

711
00:52:53,863 --> 00:52:56,492
The gods are just...

712
00:52:56,617 --> 00:53:00,079
but beloved Baelor taught us...

713
00:53:00,246 --> 00:53:02,664
they can also be merciful.

714
00:53:06,126 --> 00:53:10,213
What is to be done
with this traitor, Your Grace?

715
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,965
[Jeering, catcalls]

716
00:53:15,093 --> 00:53:18,179
My mother wishes me
to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

717
00:53:18,304 --> 00:53:23,644
Stripped of all titles and powers,
he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

718
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:27,815
And my Lady Sansa...
has begged mercy for her father.

719
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,905
But they have the soft hearts of women.

720
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,157
So long as l am your king...

721
00:53:38,284 --> 00:53:41,077
treason shall never go unpunished.

722
00:53:42,162 --> 00:53:43,371
Ser Ilyn...

723
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:45,833
bring me his head!

724
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:48,043
- No!
- [Crowd roars]

725
00:53:48,126 --> 00:53:50,003
Someone stop him!

726
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:03,267
My son, this is madness.

727
00:54:04,184 --> 00:54:05,519
[Slynt] Put him down!

728
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,195
- Don't look!
- Let me go! Let me go!

729
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,865
Shut your mouth!
Look at me! Look at me!

730
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,450
Stop! Daddy! Stop!

731
00:54:20,575 --> 00:54:22,452
- No! No!
- [Crowd] Traitor!

732
00:54:22,536 --> 00:54:23,871
[Sansa] Stop!

733
00:54:27,499 --> 00:54:29,083
Stop him! Stop!

734
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:33,255
[Clamouring fades]

735
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:34,882
[Breathes slowly]

736
00:54:58,363 --> 00:54:59,782
[Wings fluttering]

737

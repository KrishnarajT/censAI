1
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:50,720
[Bird cawing]

2
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:44,441
[Nan] The little lord's
been dreaming again.

3
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:49,403
[Growling]

4
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,534
- We have visitors.
- l don't want to see anyone.

5
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,203
Really?
If l was cooped up all day

6
00:02:57,328 --> 00:03:00,332
with no one but this old bat
for company, l'd go mad.

7
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,918
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

8
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:06,964
- l don't want to go.
- Neither do l.

9
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,881
I
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell

10
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:12,010
which means l do what he says,
and you do what l say.

11
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:15,179
Hodor!

12
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,769
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

13
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:23,897
Hodor.

14
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:33,447
[Tyrion] l must say l received
a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

15
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:36,159
[Robb] Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

16
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:38,869
Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not l, eh, boy?

17
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:41,248
l'm not your boy, Lannister.

18
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:43,458
l'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

19
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:46,837
- Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
- [Door opens]

20
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:50,798
So it's true.

21
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:54,970
Hello, Bran.

22
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:57,346
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

23
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,891
He has no memory of that day.

24
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:02,560
- Curious.
- Why are you here?

25
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,732
Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

26
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:10,319
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

27
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:15,698
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

28
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,908
Well, l mean l did like to.

29
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:20,494
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

30
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:22,706
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

31
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:25,751
- l'm not a cripple.
- Then l'm not a dwarf.

32
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,835
My father will rejoice to hear it.

33
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,213
l have a gift for you.

34
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:33,215
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

35
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:37,638
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

36
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,100
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

37
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,187
- Will l really be able to ride?
- You will.

38
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:48,482
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

39
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:51,860
ls this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

40
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:56,489
l have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples, bastards and broken things.

41
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:59,742
You've done my brother a kindness.

42
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,828
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

43
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:07,042
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There's a brothel outside your walls.

44
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:10,003
There l'll find a bed
and both of us can sleep easier.

45
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,761
Couldn't resist some northern arse?

46
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,388
lf you like Redheads, ask for Ros.

47
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:23,432
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

48
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:25,811
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

49
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:29,021
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

50
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:33,360
What happened here? Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

51
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:36,237
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

52
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,114
- Where did she go?
- M'lady's whereabouts...

53
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:40,742
M'lady? [Chuckles]

54
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,662
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.

55
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:46,747
Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

56
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:50,793
if he could see his only surviving son
has turned lackey?

57
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:54,797
l still remember seeing
my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.

58
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:58,593
- l believe your uncles were responsible.
- Must have been a pretty sight.

59
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:01,888
Nothing prettier
than watching sailors burn alive.

60
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:06,518
Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.

61
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,896
- We were outnumbered ten to one.
- A stupid rebellion, then.

62
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,400
l suppose your father realised that
when your brothers died in battle.

63
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:17,821
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

64
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:19,780
- Careful, Imp.
- l've offended you.

65
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:23,117
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

66
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:26,121
Anyway, don't despair.

67
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:28,415
l'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

68
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:30,792
and l've learned to live with it.

69
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:33,711
- [Coin clinks]
- Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

70
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,881
l'll try not to wear her out.

71
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:41,177
[Sighs]

72
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,138
[Jon] Shoulder, legs.

73
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:52,105
Leg, shoulder, leg.

74
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:55,107
Left foot forward. Good.

75
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:59,237
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.

76
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:01,739
What in seven hells is that?

77
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:06,369
- [Pyp] They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
- [Laughter]

78
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:08,412
Tell them your name.

79
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:10,499
Samwell Tarly,

80
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,503
of Horn Hill...
l mean, l was of Horn Hill.

81
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:16,213
l've come to take the black.

82
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:18,965
- Come to take the black pudding.
- [Laughter]

83
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,968
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

84
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:24,011
Rast...

85
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:26,138
see what he can do.

86
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:33,605
[Yelps]

87
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,898
[Whimpers] l yield.

88
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,567
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

89
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,821
Pick up your sword.

90
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:43,573
Hit him till he finds his feet.

91
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,451
[Samwell yelping]

92
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:52,874
[Whimpering]

93
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,626
lt seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.

94
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:58,463
- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jon!

95
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,881
- Again, harder.
- [Growns]

96
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:04,468
- [Shrieks] l yield!
- Enough!

97
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:07,513
- [Samwell sobbing]
- He yielded.

98
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:11,143
Looks like the bastard's in love.

99
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,980
All right then, Lord Snow,

100
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:19,275
you wish to defend your lady love,
Iet's make it an exercise.

101
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:22,362
You two. Three of you
ought to be sumicient

102
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:24,698
to make lady piggy squeal.

103
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:27,783
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

104
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,831
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

105
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,096
Yield, yield, yield!
l yield.

106
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:54,644
We're done for today.
Go clean the armoury.

107
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,480
That's all you're good for.

108
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,985
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

109
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:05,196
[Spits]

110
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:10,826
- Did he hurt you?
- l've had worse.

111
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:14,914
You can call me Sam...
if you want.

112
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:19,043
- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier, you know?

113
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:22,755
- You're going to have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and fight?

114
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:26,134
l wanted to.

115
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:29,012
- l just couldn't.
- Why not?

116
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,724
l'm a coward.

117
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,894
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

118
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:38,980
You're right. l'm sorry.

119
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:42,859
l just...wanted to thank you.

120
00:09:52,494 --> 00:09:54,830
A bloody coward.

121
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:59,042
People saw us talking to him.
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

122
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,960
You're too stupid to be a coward.

123
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:02,962
- You're too stupid to be a...
- Quick now,

124
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:05,965
before summer's over. [Laughing]

125
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:08,092
Come here!

126
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:17,476
[Horse neighs]

127
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,832
- [Neighs]
- Hyah, hyah!

128
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:47,132
[Jorah] Vaes Dothrak -
the city of the horselords.

129
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:51,762
A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.

130
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:55,389
- Best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.

131
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:57,808
- You shouldn't call them savages.
- l'll call them what l like,

132
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:01,687
because they're my people.
This is my army.

133
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:05,816
Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.

134
00:11:24,503 --> 00:11:27,589
lf my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

135
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:31,259
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

136
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:34,178
The Dothraki have never
crossed the narrow sea.

137
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:36,473
They fear any water
their horses can't drink.

138
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:38,182
But if they did?

139
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:42,687
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

140
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:45,398
but the men
advising him are dimerent.

141
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:49,860
- And you know these men?
- l fought beside them once,

142
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:51,904
long ago.

143
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:54,365
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

144
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,743
He drove me from my land.

145
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:00,455
You sold slaves.

146
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:03,249
Aye.

147
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:08,129
- Why?
- l had no money

148
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:10,340
and an expensive wife.

149
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:12,259
And where is she now?

150
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:14,594
ln another place,

151
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:16,930
with another man.

152
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:25,355
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

153
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:28,024
They call you the last dragon...

154
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:30,735
They do.

155
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:36,115
You have dragon's blood in your veins?

156
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:38,243
lt's entirely possible.

157
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:41,830
[Chuckles]
What happened to the dragons?

158
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:44,999
l was told that brave men
killed them all.

159
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:52,048
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

160
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:54,592
The brave men rode them.

161
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:58,095
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

162
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,682
this world has ever seen.

163
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:05,144
The breath of the greatest dragon
forged the Iron Throne,

164
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:08,148
which the Usurper is
keeping warm for me.

165
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:12,235
The swords of the vanquished,

166
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:14,488
a thousand of them...

167
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:18,951
melted together
like so many candles.

168
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:26,041
l have always wanted
to see a dragon.

169
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:29,669
There's nothing in the world
that l would rather see.

170
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:32,339
Really. Why dragons?

171
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:34,925
They can fly.

172
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:38,010
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

173
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:40,596
and they're somewhere else...

174
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,765
far away.

175
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:47,646
And they can kill.

176
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:52,859
Anyone or anything
that tries to hurt them

177
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:56,571
- gets burned away to nothing...
- [Gasps]

178
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:58,407
..melted...

179
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,326
like so many candles.

180
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,036
Ow.

181
00:14:04,787 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes. Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.

182
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,128
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

183
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,839
l imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.

184
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:16,758
l was not locked in.
l have seen things.

185
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:18,592
- What have you seen?
- l've seen...

186
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:22,596
a man from Asshai
with a dagger of real dragonglass.

187
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:24,599
- Ooh.
- l've seen a man who could

188
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,396
change his face the way
that other men change their clothes.

189
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:33,108
And l've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

190
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:37,696
and whose ship had
sails of coloured silk.

191
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,990
So...

192
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,577
have you seen one?

193
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:47,748
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

194
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,750
No.

195
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:54,379
No, the last one died
many years before l was born.

196
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:57,548
l'll tell you what l have seen -

197
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,844
their skulls.

198
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:03,930
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

199
00:15:04,013 --> 00:15:05,474
When l was very young,
just three or four,

200
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:08,100
my father used
to walk me down the rows

201
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:10,479
and l'd recite
their names for him.

202
00:15:10,604 --> 00:15:14,273
When l got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

203
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:17,277
The ones closest to the door
were the last ones they were able to hatch

204
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:21,948
and they were all stunted and wrong
with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

205
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:27,579
But... But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

206
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:30,957
they got bigger

207
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:34,085
and bigger and bigger.

208
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:39,383
There was Ghiscar

209
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:41,969
and Valryon,

210
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:43,845
Vermithrax,

211
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:46,138
Essovius... [Gasps]

212
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:48,683
I
..Archonei

213
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:52,104
Meraxes,

214
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:55,148
Vhagar...

215
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:59,903
- and Balerion the Dread...
- [Moans]

216
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:05,075
..whose fire forged
the Seven Kingdoms

217
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:07,244
into one.

218
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:14,084
What happened to the skulls?

219
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:17,671
l don't know.

220
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:21,048
The Usurper had them
smashed to powder, l expect.

221
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:24,010
Scattered to the wind.

222
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,933
- That's very sad.
- Yes, it is.

223
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:35,355
What did l buy you for?

224
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,649
- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.

225
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:43,029
To, uh, teach your sister.

226
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:46,158
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

227
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:49,452
You think l bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?

228
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,877
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

229
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:58,794
[Chuckles]

230
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,047
Go on, then.
Get on with it.

231
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:16,103
Someday your husband will sit there
and you will sit by his side.

232
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:21,693
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

233
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:26,447
All the lords of Westeros
will gather here to see the little prince.

234
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:28,658
- What if l have a girl?
- Gods be good,

235
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:31,703
you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

236
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,914
What if l only have girls?

237
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:35,916
l wouldn't worry about that.

238
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:39,211
Jeyne Poole's mother
had five children - all of them girls.

239
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:41,254
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

240
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:43,715
But what if?

241
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,135
Well, if you only had girls,

242
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:50,763
l suppose the throne would pass
to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

243
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:53,558
And everyone would hate me.

244
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:55,726
Nobody could ever hate you.

245
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:58,604
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

246
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:01,108
Why would you say such a thing?

247
00:18:02,943 --> 00:18:05,027
That business with the wolves? Sansa...

248
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:07,071
l've told you
a hundred times -

249
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:10,074
- a direwolf is not...
- Please shut up about it.

250
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:13,328
Do you remember your lessons?

251
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:20,127
- Who built the Iron Throne?
- Aegon the Conqueror.

252
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:23,796
- And who built the Red Keep?
- Maegor the Cruel.

253
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:25,715
And how many years
did it take to build...

254
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,137
My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

255
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:33,514
They were killed
on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

256
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:37,894
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

257
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:40,731
Why were they killed?

258
00:18:41,564 --> 00:18:44,359
You should speak to your father
about these matters.

259
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,570
l don't want to speak
to my father, ever.

260
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:49,822
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

261
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:53,577
- to forgive your father.
- No, l won't.

262
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:57,080
[Man] It's the Hand's Tournament
that's causing all this trouble, my lords.

263
00:18:57,164 --> 00:19:02,418
The King's Tournament.
l assure you the Hand wants no part of it.

264
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:04,545
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser,

265
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,799
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

266
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,761
Last night we had
a tavern riot, a brothel fire,

267
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:13,847
three stabbings and a drunken horse race
down the Street of Sisters.

268
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:16,641
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the king's peace,

269
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:19,770
perhaps the City Watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

270
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:21,479
- l need more men.
- [Ned] You'll get 50.

271
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:24,483
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- l will?

272
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:28,027
You found money for a champion's purse,
you can find money to keep the peace.

273
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:32,073
l'll also give you
20 of my household guard

274
00:19:32,157 --> 00:19:35,577
- till the crowds have left.
- Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.

275
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:38,455
They will be put to good use.

276
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:41,582
The sooner this is over, the better.

277
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:44,418
The realm prospers
from such events, my lord.

278
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:48,674
They give the great a chance at glory,
and the lowly a respite from their woes.

279
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,551
[Littlefinger] And every inn
in the city is full

280
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,552
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

281
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:56,055
l'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

282
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:58,641
- Hmm.
- Now...

283
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:01,186
if there's nothing else, my lords?

284
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,990
Oh, this heat.

285
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:15,908
On days like this,
l envy you northerners,

286
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:18,829
yOUr SUmmer SnOWS.
Until tomorrow, my lord.

287
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:21,622
l've been hoping
to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

288
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,417
Lord Arryn?

289
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:29,089
Oh, his death was
a great sadness to all of us.

290
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:34,218
l took personal charge of his care,
but l could not save him.

291
00:20:34,386 --> 00:20:40,100
His sickness struck him
very hard and very fast.

292
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:44,729
l saw him in my chambers
just the night before he passed.

293
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:49,693
- Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
- Why?

294
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:54,488
l have been grand maester
for many years.

295
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:57,700
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since...

296
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:00,704
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

297
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:03,165
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.

298
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:06,542
A book? What book?

299
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:11,048
Oh, l fear it would be
of little interest to you, my lord.

300
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:13,675
A... A ponderous tome.

301
00:21:13,758 --> 00:21:17,219
No, l'd like to read it.

302
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:22,642
The Lineages and Histories

303
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:25,936
of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

304
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:29,065
with descriptions
of many high lords

305
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:32,194
and noble ladies

306
00:21:32,276 --> 00:21:34,362
and their children.

307
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:54,006
Harkon Umber
first of his name,

308
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:57,802
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

309
00:21:57,843 --> 00:22:00,472
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

310
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:03,809
at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

311
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:07,270
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

312
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:09,606
of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.

313
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:13,401
As l said, my lord,
a ponderous read.

314
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:16,112
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

315
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:19,032
He did not, my lord.
And l did not presume to ask.

316
00:22:19,198 --> 00:22:21,368
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

317
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:23,911
..did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

318
00:22:23,954 --> 00:22:25,914
Nothing of import, my lord.

319
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:30,668
Oh. There was one phrase
he kept repeating.

320
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:34,089
''The seed is strong,''
l think it was.

321
00:22:34,214 --> 00:22:36,425
- ''The seed is strong''?
- Mmm.

322
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,802
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

323
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:42,555
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

324
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:44,725
For all the weight they're given,

325
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:48,561
last words are usually
as significant as first words.

326
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:51,689
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

327
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:53,817
What else could it be?

328
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:58,988
- Poison.
- A disturbing thought.

329
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:01,366
No, no, no, l don't think it likely.

330
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:05,954
The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare...

331
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,748
l've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

332
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:13,211
Yes, women, cravens...

333
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:15,046
and eunuchs.

334
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:19,301
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

335
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:23,597
- Everybody knows that.
- Yes, yes, of course.

336
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,433
How that sort of person
found himself

337
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:30,561
- on the king's council, l will never know.
- l've taken enough of your time.

338
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:33,607
No trouble at all, my lord.
It's a great honour.

339
00:23:33,732 --> 00:23:35,274
Thank you.

340
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,401
l'll find my own way out.

341
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,539
[Footsteps]

342
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,262
Syrio says a water dancer
can stand on one toe for hours.

343
00:24:04,346 --> 00:24:06,263
lt's a hard fall down these steps.

344
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:10,644
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson
and every lesson makes you better.

345
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,399
- Tomorrow l'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats? Syrio says.

346
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:18,860
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

347
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,946
They're as quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

348
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:26,118
- You have to be quick to catch them.
- He's right about that.

349
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:30,330
Now that Bran's awake,
will he come live with us?

350
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:35,793
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

351
00:24:35,877 --> 00:24:38,004
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

352
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:42,301
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

353
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:48,473
But someday
he could be lord of a holdfast

354
00:24:48,557 --> 00:24:51,517
or sit on the king's council.

355
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:56,398
Or he might raise castles
like Brandon the Builder.

356
00:24:56,439 --> 00:25:00,776
- Can l be lord of a holdfast?
- [Chuckles]

357
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:07,825
You will marry a high lord
and rule his castle.

358
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:13,040
And your sons shall be knights
and princes and lords.

359
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:17,127
- Hmm?
- No.

360
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:20,171
That's not me.

361
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:32,684
[Wind whistling]

362
00:25:42,694 --> 00:25:44,780
Hello.

363
00:25:46,156 --> 00:25:48,867
Ser Alliser said l'm to be
your new watch partner.

364
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:53,162
l should warn you,

365
00:25:53,245 --> 00:25:55,666
l don't see all that well.

366
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,668
Come stand by the fire.

367
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:01,921
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. l'm fine.

368
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:04,715
You're not. You're freezing.

369
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:19,523
l don't like high places.

370
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:23,485
You can't fight. You can't see.

371
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,988
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

372
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:30,033
What are you doing here, Sam?

373
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,292
On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.

374
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:42,795
''You're almost a man now,'' he said.

375
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,133
''But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

376
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:49,761
''Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

377
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:53,264
''forsake all claim
to your inheritance and start north.

378
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:57,644
''lf you do not,'' he said,

379
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:01,106
''then we'll have a hunt

380
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:04,318
''and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

381
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,236
''and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

382
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:11,449
''Or so l'll tell your mother.

383
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:13,952
''Nothing would please me more.''

384
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:23,712
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

385
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:25,714
- Yes, he is.
- [Groans]

386
00:27:26,631 --> 00:27:28,341
l'm not going to get
any better, you know.

387
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:31,719
Well...

388
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:33,513
you can't get any worse.

389
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,350
[Both chuckling]

390
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:46,443
l hear you're reading a boring book.

391
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:48,277
Hmph.

392
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:52,073
- Pycelle talks too much.
- Oh, he never stops.

393
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:54,533
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

394
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:57,119
Not surprising.

395
00:27:57,244 --> 00:28:01,792
Until recently, he was only
a squire - Jon Arryn's squire.

396
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:06,088
He was knighted almost immediately
after his master's untimely death.

397
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,215
Knighted for what?

398
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:12,843
- Why are you telling me this?
- l promised Cat that l'd help you.

399
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:15,179
Where is Ser Hugh?

400
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:17,975
- l'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

401
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,560
Do you see that boy there?

402
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:23,229
[Whispers] One of Varys's little birds.

403
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:26,942
The spider has taken a great interest
in your comings and goings.

404
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:28,944
Now look there.

405
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:31,946
That one belongs to the queen.

406
00:28:31,988 --> 00:28:36,243
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

407
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:40,455
- Varys or the queen?
- No, she's one of mine.

408
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:46,294
ls there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

409
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:50,924
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, my lord.

410
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:56,263
Get a message to
this paragon of yours - discreetly.

411
00:28:56,388 --> 00:28:58,932
Send him to question Ser Hugh.

412
00:28:59,057 --> 00:29:03,061
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armourer in the city.

413
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:06,023
He lives in a large house
at the top of the Street of Steel.

414
00:29:06,106 --> 00:29:08,524
- Why?
- l have my observers, as l said,

415
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:10,985
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

416
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:15,157
visit this armourer several times
in the weeks before his death.

417
00:29:16,742 --> 00:29:19,619
Lord Baelish, perhaps
l was wrong to distrust you.

418
00:29:19,703 --> 00:29:24,123
Distrusting me was the wisest thing
you've done since you climbed off your horse.

419
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,800
- [Hammering]
-. .22, 23,

420
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:37,721
24, 5, 6, 2T,

421
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:39,555
- 28, 29...
- Ser Hugh?

422
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,683
30, 31, 32...

423
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:44,019
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, l'm busy.

424
00:29:44,144 --> 00:29:49,273
l'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark,
the Hand of the King.

425
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:52,902
- l'm the captain of his guard.
- l'm sorry. l didn't catch your name, Ser...

426
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:56,156
- No ''ser''. l'm not a knight.
- l see.

427
00:29:56,197 --> 00:29:58,908
Well, it just so happens that l am.

428
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:03,664
[Continues counting]

429
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:07,000
[Jory] He said he'd be glad
to talk to the Hand himself.

430
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,294
- He's a knight, you see.
- Ah, a knight.

431
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:13,881
They strut around
like roosters down here.

432
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:16,885
Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.

433
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,719
You shouldn't be out here, my lord.

434
00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:23,265
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

435
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:27,521
The former Hand did call on me,
my lord, several times.

436
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:30,607
l regret to say he did not honour me
with his patronage.

437
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:35,152
- What did Lord Arryn want?
- He always came to see the boy.

438
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,408
- l'd like to see him as well.
- As you wish, my lord.

439
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:41,409
Gendry!

440
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:46,497
Here he is.

441
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:49,583
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

442
00:30:50,418 --> 00:30:52,545
Show the Hand
the helmet you made, lad.

443
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,103
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

444
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:11,148
Boy, this is the King's Hand!

445
00:31:11,273 --> 00:31:14,650
- If his lordship wants the helmet...
- l made it for me.

446
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:18,446
- Forgive him, my lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

447
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:22,074
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

448
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:24,077
He just asked me
questions is all, my lord.

449
00:31:24,202 --> 00:31:26,204
What kind of questions?

450
00:31:28,456 --> 00:31:31,334
About my work at first,

451
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:34,504
if l was being treated well,
if l liked it here.

452
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:39,467
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

453
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:43,054
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

454
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:45,514
What did you tell him?

455
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:49,686
She died when l was little.

456
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:51,647
She had yellow hair.

457
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:54,899
She'd sing to me sometimes.

458
00:31:58,152 --> 00:31:59,905
Look at me.

459
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:11,582
Get back to work, lad.

460
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:17,714
lf the day ever comes when that boy
would rather wield a sword than forge one,

461
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:21,217
you send him to me.

462
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:23,177
[Hammer banging]

463
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,681
Find anything?

464
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,935
King Robert's bastard son.

465
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:33,187
[Robert laughing]

466
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:35,648
- [Woman] He likes that.
- [Women laughing]

467
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:40,111
This is for the king from Lord Stark.

468
00:32:40,195 --> 00:32:42,281
- [Robert laughs]
- Should l leave it with...

469
00:32:42,406 --> 00:32:45,993
- Shhh. Listen.
- [Women laughing]

470
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:48,661
Do you hear them?

471
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:54,501
How many do you think
are in there with him? Huh?

472
00:32:55,418 --> 00:32:57,044
- Guess.
- Three.

473
00:32:57,129 --> 00:32:59,214
- [Laughter]
- Four.

474
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:03,552
He likes to do this when l'm on duty.

475
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:05,721
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

476
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:09,308
- [Door opens]
- [Laughter]

477
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,645
- Forgive me, my lord...
- Why do l have to forgive you?

478
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,147
Have you wronged me?

479
00:33:16,982 --> 00:33:21,445
- We've met before, you know.
- Have we? Strange, l've forgotten.

480
00:33:21,902 --> 00:33:25,197
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

481
00:33:25,282 --> 00:33:27,033
Ah.

482
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:29,077
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

483
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,371
- Oh.
- One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

484
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:35,292
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

485
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,711
They stopped liking it at the end.

486
00:33:38,794 --> 00:33:41,005
That was a proper battle.

487
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,342
Do you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?

488
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:48,472
With his burning sword?
l'll remember that till the day l die.

489
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:51,766
l saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

490
00:33:51,808 --> 00:33:54,519
lt was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

491
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:57,981
- Theon? He's a good lad.
- l doubt it.

492
00:33:58,064 --> 00:34:00,567
- [Laughter]
- [Door opens]

493
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:05,405
[Robert] l'll bet you smell
of blackberry jam!

494
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,367
Let me smell it. Come here.

495
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:12,912
Can l leave this with you?
The message from Lord Stark.

496
00:34:12,954 --> 00:34:15,207
l don't serve Lord Stark.

497
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,419
[Laughter continues]

498
00:34:38,396 --> 00:34:40,856
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

499
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:43,235
- With Sam.
- Ah, Prince Porkchop.

500
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,195
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

501
00:34:45,278 --> 00:34:47,071
- Impossible!
- [Chuckles]

502
00:34:47,155 --> 00:34:49,240
That's enough.

503
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:58,374
Sam's no dimerent from the rest of us.

504
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:02,003
There was no place for him in the world,
so he's come here.

505
00:35:02,086 --> 00:35:04,548
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

506
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:07,383
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

507
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:09,970
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

508
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:13,597
- [Rast] You are in love, Lord Snow.
- [Laughter]

509
00:35:14,974 --> 00:35:17,977
You girls can do as you please.

510
00:35:18,061 --> 00:35:20,814
But if Thorne puts me
up against Lady Piggy,

511
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:22,983
l'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

512
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:25,276
[Laughter]

513
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,115
[Snoring]

514
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,503
[Panting]

515
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:45,963
[Growling]

516
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,758
No one touches Sam.

517
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:05,274
What are you waiting for?

518
00:36:14,952 --> 00:36:16,244
Attack him!

519
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:28,756
You get in there.

520
00:36:33,512 --> 00:36:35,180
Hit me.

521
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:38,517
Go on, hit me!

522
00:36:38,642 --> 00:36:40,602
[Shouts]

523
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:43,104
- l yield!
- [Laughter]

524
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:45,064
Yield. Yield.

525
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:47,316
l yield.

526
00:36:50,278 --> 00:36:52,655
You think this is funny, do you?

527
00:36:56,367 --> 00:37:01,081
When you're out there
beyond the Wall with the sun going down,

528
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:02,916
do you want a man at your back?

529
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:05,376
Or a snivelling boy?

530
00:37:13,175 --> 00:37:15,303
[Sobbing]

531
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,436
You send this whore
to give me commands?

532
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,187
l should have sent you back her head!

533
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:27,524
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
l did as you asked.

534
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:30,651
Hush now. It's all right.
Irri, take her and leave us.

535
00:37:30,776 --> 00:37:32,945
Yes, Khaleesi.

536
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:38,160
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do l have to tell you?

537
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:42,039
- You do not command me.
- l wasn't commanding you.

538
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:43,749
l just wanted to invite you to supper.

539
00:37:43,832 --> 00:37:46,001
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

540
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:48,711
- l had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

541
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:50,671
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

542
00:37:50,756 --> 00:37:53,216
This stinks of manure. All of it.

543
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:55,218
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

544
00:37:55,343 --> 00:37:57,803
You would turn me
into one of them, wouldn't you?

545
00:37:57,887 --> 00:38:00,557
- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no right to a braid.

546
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,394
- You've won no victories yet.
- You do not talk back to me!

547
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:11,151
You are a horselord's slut.
And now you've woken the dragon...

548
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,488
- [Metal jangles]
- [Screams]

549
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,494
l am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!

550
00:38:20,535 --> 00:38:25,624
l am the wife of the great khal
and l carry his son inside me.

551
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:29,503
The next time you raise a hand to me

552
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:32,673
will be the last time you have hands.

553
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:36,677
[Thunder rumbles, rain falling]

554
00:38:40,513 --> 00:38:43,849
l know for a fact that some of the officers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

555
00:38:43,934 --> 00:38:46,352
l wouldn't doubt it.

556
00:38:46,477 --> 00:38:48,646
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

557
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:53,860
Making us take our vows while they sneak off
for a little Sally on the side?

558
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:56,363
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

559
00:38:56,488 --> 00:38:59,825
What, we can't defend
the Wall unless we're celibate?

560
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:04,579
- It's absurd.
- l didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

561
00:39:05,622 --> 00:39:07,374
Why not?

562
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,292
Because l'm fat?

563
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,796
- No.
- But l like girls just as much as you do.

564
00:39:14,131 --> 00:39:16,550
They might not like me as much.

565
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:21,722
l've never...been with one.

566
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,642
You've probably had hundreds.

567
00:39:25,684 --> 00:39:26,684
No.

568
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:30,771
As a matter of fact,

569
00:39:31,731 --> 00:39:33,441
l'm the same as you.

570
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:35,568
Yeah. Yeah, l...

571
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:37,403
l find that hard to believe.

572
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:40,032
l came very close once.

573
00:39:40,115 --> 00:39:43,242
l was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but...

574
00:39:44,244 --> 00:39:47,664
- Didn't know where to put it?
- l know where to put it.

575
00:39:48,206 --> 00:39:49,624
Was she...

576
00:39:49,749 --> 00:39:51,834
old and ugly?

577
00:39:52,794 --> 00:39:54,588
Young and gorgeous.

578
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:58,008
A whore named Ros.

579
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,137
What colour hair?

580
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:04,972
- Red.
- Oh, l like red hair.

581
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:07,934
And her, um...

582
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,811
Her...

583
00:40:10,227 --> 00:40:12,439
- You don't want to know.
- What, that good?

584
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:14,274
- Better.
- Oh, no.

585
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:21,448
So why exactly did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect...?

586
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:26,954
- What's my name?
- Jon Snow.

587
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:30,039
And why is my surname Snow?

588
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:33,042
Because...

589
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:35,503
you're a bastard from the North.

590
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:39,925
l never met my mother.

591
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:42,718
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

592
00:40:42,803 --> 00:40:44,930
l don't know if she's living or dead.

593
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:51,436
l don't know if she's a noblewoman
or a fisherman's wife...

594
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:55,314
or a whore.

595
00:40:57,441 --> 00:40:59,861
So l sat there

596
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:03,155
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

597
00:41:04,448 --> 00:41:06,785
But l couldn't do it.

598
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,291
Because all l could think was
what if l got her pregnant

599
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:17,421
and she had a child,
another bastard named Snow?

600
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:24,845
lt's not a good life for a child.

601
00:41:24,928 --> 00:41:27,055
Ah, mmm.

602
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:31,309
So...

603
00:41:32,144 --> 00:41:34,104
you didn't know where to put it?

604
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:37,481
[Laughing]

605
00:41:39,943 --> 00:41:41,945
Enjoying yourselves?

606
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:45,907
You look cold, boys.

607
00:41:46,032 --> 00:41:48,910
- [Door creaks]
- It is a bit nippy.

608
00:41:48,994 --> 00:41:51,829
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

609
00:41:51,997 --> 00:41:53,914
indoors.

610
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,709
lt's still summer.

611
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,588
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

612
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:03,550
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

613
00:42:04,508 --> 00:42:06,178
l remember.

614
00:42:06,218 --> 00:42:08,722
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

615
00:42:08,805 --> 00:42:10,807
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

616
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:14,227
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

617
00:42:14,352 --> 00:42:17,189
- l build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

618
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:21,360
l spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

619
00:42:21,485 --> 00:42:24,236
during the last winter.

620
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,240
lt was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

621
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:31,577
We heard a rumour Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

622
00:42:31,662 --> 00:42:34,497
So we went out to look
for some of his men -

623
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:37,249
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

624
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:40,878
The wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

625
00:42:41,003 --> 00:42:43,131
Harder than you'll ever be.

626
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:45,716
They know their country
better than we do.

627
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,303
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

628
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:52,890
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

629
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:56,477
And we got caught in the open.

630
00:42:56,602 --> 00:42:58,354
Wind so strong

631
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:02,526
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground, roots and all.

632
00:43:02,693 --> 00:43:05,403
lf you took your gloves off
to find your cock to have a piss,

633
00:43:05,486 --> 00:43:08,573
you lost a finger to the frost.

634
00:43:08,657 --> 00:43:10,492
And all in darkness.

635
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:16,206
You don't know cold.

636
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:18,207
Neither of you do.

637
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:23,046
The horses died first.

638
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:28,760
We didn't have enough
to feed them, to keep them warm.

639
00:43:30,637 --> 00:43:33,055
Eating the horses was easy.

640
00:43:35,224 --> 00:43:38,102
But later when we started to fall...

641
00:43:39,896 --> 00:43:41,939
That wasn't easy.

642
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:46,903
We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?

643
00:43:49,948 --> 00:43:51,532
- [Grabs]
- [Gasps]

644
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,160
Soft, fat boys like you.

645
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:59,249
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you
and still had bones left over for soup.

646
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:04,838
Soon we'll have new recruits

647
00:44:04,921 --> 00:44:08,216
and you lot will be passed along
to the lord commander

648
00:44:08,383 --> 00:44:10,302
for assignment,

649
00:44:10,427 --> 00:44:14,890
and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,

650
00:44:14,972 --> 00:44:16,599
but you'd be fools to believe it.

651
00:44:18,352 --> 00:44:20,187
You're boys still.

652
00:44:20,354 --> 00:44:23,899
And come the winter you will die...

653
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:27,443
like flies.

654
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,035
l hit him.

655
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,537
l hit the dragon.

656
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,914
Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.

657
00:44:39,997 --> 00:44:42,626
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

658
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:46,796
- He is still the true king.
- The truth now.

659
00:44:46,963 --> 00:44:50,925
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

660
00:44:51,008 --> 00:44:52,510
No.

661
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,638
But the common people
are waiting for him.

662
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,017
lllyrio said they are sewing dragon banners
and praying for his return.

663
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:04,814
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

664
00:45:04,898 --> 00:45:08,193
They don't care
what games the high lords play.

665
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:10,988
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

666
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,367
Home.

667
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:19,704
l pray for home too.

668
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:26,211
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

669
00:45:27,921 --> 00:45:31,758
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

670
00:45:34,635 --> 00:45:36,972
He'll never take us home.

671
00:45:38,265 --> 00:45:40,309
[Crowd chattering and yelling]

672
00:45:46,898 --> 00:45:48,233
[Horse whinnies]

673
00:45:56,907 --> 00:45:59,077
Lovers' quarrel?

674
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,662
l'm sorry. Do l...?

675
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:03,164
Sansa dear
this is Lord Bae!lish.

676
00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:05,416
- He's known...
- An old friend of the family.

677
00:46:06,292 --> 00:46:08,461
l've known your mother a long, long time.

678
00:46:08,586 --> 00:46:10,756
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

679
00:46:10,796 --> 00:46:13,675
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

680
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,887
When l was a child, l was very small,

681
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,097
and l come from a little spit of land
called the Fingers,

682
00:46:20,182 --> 00:46:24,352
SO yOU See,
it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

683
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:27,146
l've been sitting here for days!

684
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:30,816
Start the damn joust
before l piss myself!

685
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:32,945
[Crowd cheering]

686
00:46:38,575 --> 00:46:41,160
Gods, who's that?

687
00:46:41,285 --> 00:46:43,664
[Littlefinger] Ser Gregor Clegane.

688
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:46,666
They call him the Mountain.

689
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:50,963
The Hound's older brother.

690
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:54,216
- And his opponent?
- [Littlefinger] Ser Hugh of the Vale.

691
00:46:54,341 --> 00:46:56,175
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

692
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,885
Look how far he's come.

693
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:02,224
Yes, yes, enough of
the bloody pomp. Have at him!

694
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:12,274
[Horse neighs]

695
00:47:42,097 --> 00:47:43,890
[Screams]

696
00:47:44,932 --> 00:47:47,394
[Crowd gasps]

697
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,604
[Gurgling]

698
00:47:55,736 --> 00:47:57,528
[Fly buzzing]

699
00:48:22,178 --> 00:48:24,222
Not what you were expecting?

700
00:48:27,725 --> 00:48:31,354
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

701
00:48:32,814 --> 00:48:35,149
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

702
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,780
The Hound was just a pup,

703
00:48:39,905 --> 00:48:42,073
six years old maybe.

704
00:48:42,198 --> 00:48:44,200
Gregor a few years older,

705
00:48:44,283 --> 00:48:48,079
already a big lad,
already getting a bit of a reputation.

706
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:54,086
Some lucky boys just born
with a talent for violence.

707
00:48:54,211 --> 00:49:00,300
One evening Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the fire -

708
00:49:00,425 --> 00:49:02,718
Gregor's toy,

709
00:49:02,803 --> 00:49:05,472
a wooden knight.

710
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:07,474
Gregor never said a word,

711
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,559
he just grabbed his brother
by the scrum of his neck

712
00:49:10,644 --> 00:49:13,981
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

713
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:17,733
Held him there
while the boy screamed,

714
00:49:17,818 --> 00:49:19,986
while his face melted.

715
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:28,160
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

716
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:31,832
- l won't tell anyone. l promise.
- No, please don't.

717
00:49:31,914 --> 00:49:35,209
lf the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

718
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:39,631
l'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing
would not be able to save you.

719
00:49:50,057 --> 00:49:52,184
[Knocking]

720
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:55,479
My lord, Her Grace the queen.

721
00:49:58,608 --> 00:50:01,278
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

722
00:50:01,403 --> 00:50:04,573
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

723
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:09,494
l thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us -

724
00:50:09,577 --> 00:50:12,247
the ugliness with the wolves.

725
00:50:13,582 --> 00:50:16,042
And forcing you to kill the beast
was extreme.

726
00:50:17,336 --> 00:50:20,838
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

727
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,841
How is Sansa?

728
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,845
- She likes it here.
- She's the only Stark who does.

729
00:50:28,805 --> 00:50:31,892
Favours her mother
not much of the North in' her.

730
00:50:31,974 --> 00:50:35,687
- What are you doing here?
- l might ask the same of you.

731
00:50:35,812 --> 00:50:37,898
What is it you hope to accomplish?

732
00:50:38,023 --> 00:50:40,858
The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,

733
00:50:40,983 --> 00:50:43,361
and that's what l'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

734
00:50:43,445 --> 00:50:46,113
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

735
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,867
He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.

736
00:50:48,992 --> 00:50:51,745
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

737
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,497
lf that's my job, then so be it.

738
00:50:56,082 --> 00:50:58,459
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

739
00:50:58,542 --> 00:51:02,171
You take your orders
and you carry on.

740
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:04,216
l suppose it makes sense.

741
00:51:04,383 --> 00:51:07,385
Your older brother was trained to lead
and you were trained to follow.

742
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,597
l was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.

743
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:16,352
As was l.

744
00:51:20,731 --> 00:51:24,695
[Door opens, closes]

745
00:51:27,613 --> 00:51:29,657
[Horse snorts]

746
00:51:30,658 --> 00:51:32,785
[Dog barking]

747
00:51:34,454 --> 00:51:36,247
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

748
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:38,166
And to you.

749
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:40,459
Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

750
00:51:40,584 --> 00:51:42,963
Ah, good idea, Grandfather.
l'm starving.

751
00:51:43,088 --> 00:51:46,675
- A song while we wait or...?
- l'd rather throw myself down a well.

752
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:50,345
Now, now, Grandfather, this may be
your last chance if you're heading North.

753
00:51:50,512 --> 00:51:53,515
The only music the northerners know
is the howling of wolves!

754
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,474
- [Laughs]
- [Door opens]

755
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,144
Gods.

756
00:51:57,269 --> 00:51:58,812
l'm sorry, my lord. We're full up.

757
00:51:58,894 --> 00:52:01,773
- Every room.
- [Tyrion] My men can sleep in the stable.

758
00:52:01,856 --> 00:52:04,985
As for myself, l don't
require a large room.

759
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:10,073
- Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
- Is there nothing l can do...

760
00:52:10,198 --> 00:52:12,575
- [Coin clanks]
- ..to remedy this?

761
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,954
- You can have my room.
- Now there's a clever man.

762
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:20,291
You can manage food, l trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

763
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:22,336
- Aye, my lord.
- My lord of Lannister!

764
00:52:22,419 --> 00:52:25,004
Might l entertain you while you eat?

765
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:27,883
l can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

766
00:52:28,008 --> 00:52:31,637
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

767
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:35,890
Lady Stark!
What an unexpected pleasure.

768
00:52:36,557 --> 00:52:39,352
l was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

769
00:52:39,477 --> 00:52:41,271
Lady Stark!

770
00:52:49,195 --> 00:52:53,908
l was still Catelyn Tully
the last time l stayed here.

771
00:52:56,285 --> 00:52:58,497
You, ser.

772
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:03,709
ls that the black bat of Harrenhal
l see embroidered on your coat?

773
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:05,294
lt is, my lady.

774
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:08,090
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest friend

775
00:53:08,173 --> 00:53:12,218
to my father,
Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

776
00:53:12,343 --> 00:53:13,887
She is.

777
00:53:16,013 --> 00:53:19,434
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

778
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,856
My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst
his oldest and most loyal bannermen.

779
00:53:24,939 --> 00:53:27,526
Our lord is honoured by his trust.

780
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:30,570
l envy your father
all his fine friends, Lady Stark,

781
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:34,198
but l don't quite see
the purpose of this.

782
00:53:35,658 --> 00:53:37,660
l know your sigil as well -

783
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:41,581
the twin towers of Frey.

784
00:53:41,707 --> 00:53:43,874
How fares your lord, ser?

785
00:53:44,542 --> 00:53:46,378
Lord Walder is well, my lady.

786
00:53:46,461 --> 00:53:50,090
He has asked your father for the honour
of his presence on his 90th nameday.

787
00:53:50,215 --> 00:53:52,383
- He plans to take another wife.
- [Tyrion] Ha!

788
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:00,975
This man...

789
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:04,062
came into my house as a guest

790
00:54:04,104 --> 00:54:08,066
and there conspired
to murder my son.

791
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:11,403
A boy of 10.

792
00:54:13,155 --> 00:54:16,325
ln the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

793
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:19,244
l call upon you to seize him

794
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:22,747
and help me return him to Winterfell

795
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:25,207
to await the king's justice.

796
00:54:31,914 --> 00:54:36,207

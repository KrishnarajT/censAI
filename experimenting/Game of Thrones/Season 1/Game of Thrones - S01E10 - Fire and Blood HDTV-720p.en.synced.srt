Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,160
You'll be coming with me, boy,
and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

lt told me to come with him, so l did.

14

We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

[Osha] Your father's not down there, little lord.

That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

25
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:17,024
Robert started a war to win her back.

He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.

27
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,824

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,642
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

180
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:18,603
The King in the North!

181
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:22,690
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

182
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:24,401
The King in the North!

183
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:31,324
- Lady Stark.
- l want to see him.

184
00:15:32,617 --> 00:15:34,035
Now!

185
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,833
[Prisoners coughing]

186
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:56,433
Leave us.

187
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,775
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.

188
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,609
Widowhood becomes you.

189
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:11,406
Your bed must be lonely.

190
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,324
ls that why you came?

191
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,121
l'm not at my best,
but l think l could be of service.

192
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:22,000
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if l'm up to it.

193
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,670
[Groans]

194
00:16:26,338 --> 00:16:29,424
Oh, l do like a violent woman.

195
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:33,428
l will kill you tonight, ser...

196
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:36,265
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

197
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:37,808
Let me show you how...

198
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,310
Hit me again, over the ear.

199
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:45,439
And again and again. You're stronger
than you look. It shouldn't take long.

200
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:49,194
That is what you want the world to believe,
isn't it? That you don't fear death.

201
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:51,487
But l don't, my lady.

202
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:54,824
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

203
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:58,494
Because you are going
to the deepest of the seven hells,

204
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:01,790
- if the gods are just.
- What gods are those?

205
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,961
The trees your husband prayed to?

206
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:09,255
Where were the trees
when his head was getting chopped off?

207
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:13,135
lf your gods are real and if they are just...

208
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:15,386
why is the world so full of injustice?

209
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:19,640
Because of men like you.

210
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:23,185
There are no men like me.

211
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,313
Only me.

212
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:32,820
My son Bran.

213
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:36,366
How did he come to fall from that tower?

214
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,992
l pushed him out the window.

215
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:42,955
Why?

216
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:47,502
l...hoped the fall would kill him.

217
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:49,003
Why?

218
00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:59,348
You should get some sleep.

219
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,683
lt's going to be a long war.

220
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,043
l can't believe we're actually at war.

221
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:33,382
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

222
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:39,221
What does it say?

223
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:42,848
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

224
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:45,226
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

225
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:48,437
Get back into bed.

226
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,406
They have my son.

227
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:04,329
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

228
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:07,707
l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men
and as many horses.

229
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,417
ls it true about Stannis and Renly?

230
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:12,212
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

231
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:14,798
Jaime captured, his armies scattered...

232
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,716
lt's a catastrophe.

233
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,720
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

234
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:21,887
[Goblet shatters]

235
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,892
There's your peace.

236
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:29,687
Joffrey saw to that when he decided
to remove Ned Stark's head.

237
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:32,899
You'll have an easier time
drinking from that cup

238
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:36,028
than you will bringing Robb Stark
to the table now.

239
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:37,570
He's winning...

240
00:19:37,695 --> 00:19:41,867
- in case you hadn't noticed.
- l'm told we still have his sisters.

241
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,328
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

242
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:47,664
No truces. We can't afford to look weak.
We should march on them at once.

243
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:50,000
First we must return to Casterly Rock
to raise...

244
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:52,543
They have my son!

245
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:57,257
Get out, all of you.

246
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,936
Not you.

247
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:27,663
You were right about Eddard Stark.

248
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:35,753
lf he were alive, we could have used him to
broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,

249
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:41,342
which would have given us more time
to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...

250
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:44,346
Madness. Madness and stupidity.

251
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,351
l always thought you were a stunted fool.

252
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:54,188
Perhaps l was wrong.

253
00:20:54,356 --> 00:20:55,983
Half wrong.

254
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,986
l'm new to strategy, but...

255
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:04,073
Unless we want to be surrounded
by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.

256
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:06,867
No one will stay here.

257
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:09,620
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders

258
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:13,791
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

259
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,919
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.

260
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:21,300
And you will go to King's Landing.

261
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:24,761
- And do what?
- Rule.

262
00:21:26,012 --> 00:21:29,098
You will serve as Hand of the King
in my stead.

263
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:32,394
You will bring that boy king to heel,
and his mother too, if needs be.

264
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,147
And if you get so much as a whim of treason
from any of the rest -

265
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:39,275
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...
- Heads, spikes, walls.

266
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:42,737
Why not my uncle?

267
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:45,072
Why not anyone? Why me?

268
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:47,533
You're my son.

269
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,293
Oh, one more thing.

270
00:21:57,336 --> 00:22:00,672
You will not take that whore to court.

271
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,465
Do you understand?

272
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,806
[Animals calling]

273
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:23,779
Ser Jorah?

274
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:30,953
Gently, gently.

275
00:22:32,913 --> 00:22:34,455
My son...

276
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:36,916
Where is he? l want him.

277
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,338
Where is he?

278
00:22:43,548 --> 00:22:45,634
The boy did not live.

279
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:55,519
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

280
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:57,896
How did my son die?

281
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:02,483
He never lived, my princess.

282
00:23:02,568 --> 00:23:04,069
The women say...

283
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:06,320
What do the women say?

284
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:13,912
- They say the child was...
- [Mirri] Monstrous, twisted.

285
00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:15,914
l pulled him out myself.

286
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,042
He was scaled like a lizard,

287
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:24,380
blind, with leather wings
like the wings of a bat.

288
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:27,550
When l touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

289
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:31,429
lnside...he was full of graveworms.

290
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:38,395
l warned you that only death
can pay for life.

291
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:40,396
You knew the price.

292
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:43,399
Where is Khal Drogo?

293
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:45,569
Show him to me.

294
00:23:45,694 --> 00:23:51,073
Show me what l bought with my son's life.

295
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:53,159
As you command, lady.

296
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:56,704
Come. l will take you to him.

297
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:59,625
- Time enough for that later...
- l want to see him now.

298
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,600
The khalasar is gone.

299
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:20,436
A khal who cannot ride is no khal.

300
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:23,190
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

301
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:26,193
l'm sorry, my Princess.

302
00:24:38,163 --> 00:24:39,414
Drogo!

303
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:42,833
[Speaks Dothraki] *Shekh ma shieraki anni!*
My sun and stars.

304
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,627
Why is he out here alone?

305
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:47,588
He seems to like the warmth, Princess.

306
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,636
[Mirri] He lives.

307
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,764
You asked for life, you paid for life.

308
00:24:56,848 --> 00:25:00,060
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

309
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:03,230
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east.

310
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:08,277
When the seas go dry. When the mountains
blow in the wind like leaves.

311
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:25,127
Leave us.

312
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:28,838
l don't want you alone with this sorceress.

313
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:32,134
l have nothing more to fear
from this woman.

314
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:35,220
Go.

315
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:44,312
You knew what l was buying
and you knew the price.

316
00:25:45,062 --> 00:25:47,023
lt was wrong of them to burn my temple.

317
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:50,652
- It angered the Great Shepherd.
- This is not God's work.

318
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:53,739
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

319
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:56,825
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

320
00:25:56,908 --> 00:26:01,120
Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar
will trample no nations into dust.

321
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:03,665
[Daenerys] l spoke for you.

322
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,835
- l saved you.
- [Chuckles] Saved me?

323
00:26:08,962 --> 00:26:13,591
Three of those riders had already
raped me before you saved me, girl.

324
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:19,056
l saw my god's house burn,

325
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:23,685
there where l had healed men and women
beyond counting.

326
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,104
ln the streets l saw piles of heads...

327
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,565
the head of the baker who makes my bread,

328
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:32,985
the head of a young boy that l had
cured of fever just three moons past.

329
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:38,282
So... tell me again
exactly what it was that you saved?

330
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:40,327
Your life.

331
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:44,873
Why don't you take a look at your khal...

332
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,586
Then you will see exactly
what life is worth...

333
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:52,380
when all the rest has gone.

334
00:27:05,185 --> 00:27:06,727
You can't!

335
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,606
Get out of my way, Sam.

336
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:11,608
They'll put out the word.

337
00:27:11,692 --> 00:27:15,279
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

338
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:18,240
Do you know what happens to deserters?

339
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:22,411
Better than you do.

340
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:25,038
What are you going to do?

341
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:27,081
l'm gonna find my brother

342
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:30,002
and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

343
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:34,589
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

344
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:38,467
- Move.
- l won't let you go.

345
00:27:39,051 --> 00:27:41,262
- Move.
- No.

346
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,848
- Hyah!
- [Neighs]

347
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:45,349
[Grunts]

348
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:01,657
Hand of the King?

349
00:28:01,742 --> 00:28:03,868
So it would seem.

350
00:28:03,993 --> 00:28:08,373
And your father said you couldn't
take anyone with you to King's Landing?

351
00:28:08,498 --> 00:28:11,126
No, he said l couldn't take you with me
to King's Landing.

352
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:15,047
- He was very specific on that point.
- He knew my name?

353
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:16,756
What?

354
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:19,467
He said,
''Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing''?

355
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,428
l believe he used the word ''whore''.

356
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:25,598
Are you ashamed of me?

357
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,810
Are you afraid that l'm dancing around
the court with my tits out?

358
00:28:28,935 --> 00:28:30,479
[Chuckles]

359
00:28:30,604 --> 00:28:31,771
l'm funny now?

360
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:34,023
l'm Shae, the funny whore.

361
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:38,278
My father's probably the most powerful man
in the country.

362
00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:39,862
Certainly the richest.

363
00:28:39,987 --> 00:28:42,406
He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.

364
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:47,412
Everyone everywhere always has to do
exactly what my father says.

365
00:28:48,955 --> 00:28:50,831
He's always been a cunt.

366
00:28:57,964 --> 00:29:01,217
l believe the ladies of the court
could learn a great deal

367
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:03,052
from a girl like you.

368
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:09,393
Why don't you come with me,
be the Hand's lady?

369
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:14,106
Because the king needs a Hand
and the Hand...

370
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:20,111
l know what a Hand needs.

371
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:31,790
[Ghost barks]
[Men shouting]

372
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:34,960
Ghost?

373
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,168
[Man] Hyah!

374
00:29:36,294 --> 00:29:38,629
Hyah! Hyah!

375
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:43,092
Hyah!

376
00:29:44,427 --> 00:29:45,803
[Shrieks]

377
00:29:46,512 --> 00:29:47,431
[Neighs]

378
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:49,098
Samwell!

379
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,102
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.

380
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:54,812
[Samwell] Did we get him?

381
00:29:54,855 --> 00:29:56,732
[Grenn] Come on, help me get him up.

382
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:02,236
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

383
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:06,282
We're taking you back to where you belong.

384
00:30:06,366 --> 00:30:08,952
- l belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

385
00:30:09,077 --> 00:30:10,913
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.

386
00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:13,290
They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.

387
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:16,460
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

388
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:19,171
- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.

389
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:21,631
You took the oath. You can't leave.

390
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:23,759
- l have to.
- You can't.

391
00:30:23,925 --> 00:30:26,219
- You said the words.
- l don't care about...

392
00:30:26,345 --> 00:30:29,473
''Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow...''

393
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:33,810
- To hell with all of you.
- ''Night gathers and now my watch begins.

394
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:37,063
''lt shall not end until my death.

395
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:39,148
''l shall live and die at my post.''

''l am the sword in the darkness...''

397
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:42,860
''The watcher on the walls...''

398
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:45,614
[All] ''The shield that guards the realms of men.

399
00:30:45,696 --> 00:30:49,367
''l pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch,

00:30:49,492 --> 00:30:53,163
''for this night and all nights to come.''

00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:27,114
[Water spatters]

00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:37,124
[Speaks Dothraki] *Hash yer vineseri dothrakh ataki kishi, zhey shekh ma shieraki anni?*
Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars?

403

[Speaks Dothraki] *Hash yer laz chari anna; hash yer ray vos o, attihas anna.*

You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter.

405
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:56,685
[Speaks Dothraki] *Anha zigerek yeroon lajat ajjin.*
l need you to fight now.

00:32:05,402 --> 00:32:09,740
[Speaks Dothraki] *Affin shekh yola,*

[Speaks Dothraki] *affin mae drae fey, shekh ma shieraki anni.*
but come back to me, my sun and stars.

408
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:39,394
[ln English] When the sun...

409
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:41,980
rises in the west...

410
00:32:43,022 --> 00:32:45,483
..and sets in the east...

[Sobs]

412
00:32:48,904 --> 00:32:52,115
...then you shall return to me,
my sun and stars.

[Sobbing]

414
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:01,018
Kings? [Chuckles]

415
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:05,856
Oh, l can tell you all there is
to know about kings.

416
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:10,985
The thing you need to understand
about kings is...

417
00:34:15,782 --> 00:34:19,744
For the past 6T years, l've known...

418
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:24,708
truly known...
more kings than any man alive.

419
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:30,797
They're complicated men,
but l know how to serve them.

420
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,840
[Chuckles] Yes.

421
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:35,344
And keep on serving them. [Coughs]

422
00:34:37,721 --> 00:34:39,848
Aerys Targaryen.

423
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:46,270
Of all the thousand thousand maladies
the gods visit on us...

424
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:49,565
madness is the worst.

425
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:52,610
He was a good man.

426
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,739
Such a charmer.

427
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:59,451
To watch him melt away before my eyes...

428
00:35:00,409 --> 00:35:04,915
consumed by dreams of fire and blood...

429
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,672
Robert Baratheon
was an entirely different animal -

430
00:35:11,797 --> 00:35:14,465
powerful man, great warrior -

431
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:20,554
but alas, winning a kingdom
and ruling a kingdom

432
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:22,933
are rather different things.

433
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:24,518
They say that...

434
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:28,105
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

435
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:33,569
he can often be blind
to the enemies at his side. [Chuckles]

436
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:38,239
[Coughs] Now l serve his son...

437
00:35:39,074 --> 00:35:40,741
King Joffrey...

438
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:43,411
may the gods bless his reign.

439
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:48,750
He is a capable young man -
strong military mind.

440
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:50,960
Stern.

441
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:55,382
But sternness in defence of the realm
is no vice.

442
00:35:55,465 --> 00:35:57,092
[Coughs]

443
00:35:57,259 --> 00:36:01,387
lt's far too soon to know
what manner of king he will be, but...

444
00:36:01,512 --> 00:36:07,518
l sense true greatness on the horizon
for our new king.

445
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:09,270
Mmm. [Coughs]

446
00:36:09,395 --> 00:36:11,648
True greatness.

447
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:17,945
So what's the thing?

448
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:21,407
What thing?

449
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:23,284
About kings.

450
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:27,204
You said, ''The thing you
need to understand about kings...''

451
00:36:27,246 --> 00:36:29,206
What? Things? What?

452
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:32,377
When you started, you...
Never mind.

453
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,963
[Mutters] Let me see you out, my dear.

454
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:39,050
- It's all right. No need.
- Yes, yes.

455
00:36:39,134 --> 00:36:41,219
Till the next time.

456
00:36:41,261 --> 00:36:42,929
[Door closes]

457
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:48,185
[Sighs]

458
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:03,282
Right.

459
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:07,246
[Muttering]

460
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:16,630
[Groans]

461
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,938
When you imagine yourself up there,
how do you look?

462
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:35,357
Does the crown fit?

463
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,692
Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow,

464
00:37:37,817 --> 00:37:40,779
the ones who sneered at you for years?

465
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:44,241
lt's hard for them to simper and bow
without heads.

466
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,828
A man with great ambition and no morals -

467
00:37:47,953 --> 00:37:50,538
l wouldn't bet against you.

468
00:37:51,498 --> 00:37:56,587
And what would you do, my friend,
if you found yourself sitting up there?

469
00:37:56,712 --> 00:38:00,090
l must be one of the few men in this city
who doesn't want to be King.

470
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:03,759
You must be one of the few men in the city
who isn't a man.

471
00:38:03,884 --> 00:38:05,469
Oh, you can do better than that.

472
00:38:10,058 --> 00:38:13,436
When they castrated you,
did they take the pillar with the stones?

473
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,355
- l've always wondered.
- Have you?

474
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,650
Do you spend a lot of time
wondering what's between my legs?

475
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:23,864
l picture... a gash. Like a woman's.
Is that about right?

476
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:26,824
l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.

477
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:30,746
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years...

478
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:33,665
a man from another land,

479
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,083
despised by most,

480
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,460
feared by all...

481
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:39,170
Am l? That is good to know.

482
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:42,632
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

483
00:38:42,674 --> 00:38:44,800
But you carry on...

484
00:38:44,884 --> 00:38:48,971
whispering in one king's ear
and then the next.

485
00:38:51,224 --> 00:38:53,018
l admire you.

486
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:56,395
And l admire you, Lord Baelish.

487
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,942
A grasper from a minor House with
a major talent for befriending powerful men...

488
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:04,070
- and women.
- A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.

489
00:39:06,657 --> 00:39:08,407
So...

490
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:10,534
here we stand...

491
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:13,121
in mutual admiration and respect.

492
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:15,290
Playing our roles.

493
00:39:15,415 --> 00:39:16,750
Serving a new king.

494
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:19,168
Long may he reign.

495
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:21,420
- My king.
- My king.

496
00:39:22,755 --> 00:39:25,842
My lords. Shall we begin?

497
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:28,762
[Yoren] You're Arry now, hear me?

498
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:30,806
Arry the orphan boy.

499
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:35,561
No one asks an orphan too many questions,
cos nobody gives three shits.

500
00:39:35,726 --> 00:39:37,563
What's your name?

501
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:38,855
Arry.

502
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,567
You've a long way to travel,
and in bad company.

503
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,862
l've 20 this time -
men and boys all bound for the Wall.

504
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:50,241
Your lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons,

505
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:53,619
and l didn't find no little lordlings
down there.

506
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:55,038
This lot -

507
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:59,000
half of them would turn you over to the king
quick as spit for a pardon.

508
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:03,170
And the other half would do the same,
except they'd rape you first.

509
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,842
So keep to yourself -
and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.

510
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:11,596
You stay with this lot, boy.

511
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:13,223
And stay...

512
00:40:13,348 --> 00:40:17,018
or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon
with these three.

513
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:23,357
Watch yourself, midget.

514
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:26,069
He's got a sword, this one.

515
00:40:26,235 --> 00:40:28,739
What's a gutter rat like you
doing with a sword?

516
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:31,824
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

517
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:33,534
He looks like a girl.

518
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:35,746
l bet he stole that sword.

519
00:40:36,996 --> 00:40:38,206
Let's have a look.

520
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,753
l could use me a sword like that.

521
00:40:42,878 --> 00:40:45,212
- Take it off him.
- Give it here, midget.

522
00:40:45,297 --> 00:40:48,090
Look at him.
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.

523
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:50,052
l've seen him kick a boy to death.

524
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:52,346
l knocked him down
and l kicked him in the balls

525
00:40:52,512 --> 00:40:54,723
and l kept kicking him
until he was dead.

526
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:56,641
l kicked him all to pieces.

527
00:40:58,226 --> 00:41:01,270
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

528
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:03,065
l'll give it to you.

529
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:05,817
l already killed one fat boy.

530
00:41:05,942 --> 00:41:08,320
l bet you never killed anyone.

531
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:11,156
l bet you're a liar. But l'm not.

532
00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:13,157
l'm good at killing fat boys.

533
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:14,909
l like killing fat boys.

534
00:41:14,992 --> 00:41:16,786
[Gasps]

535
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:19,081
You like picking on the little ones, do you?

536
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:21,875
l've been hammering an anvil
these past 10 years.

537
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,378
When l hit that steel, it sings.

538
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:27,255
Are you gonna sing when l hit you?

539
00:41:33,844 --> 00:41:36,139
This is castle-forged steel.

540
00:41:36,223 --> 00:41:38,349
Where'd you steal it?

541
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:41,143
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

542
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,688
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

543
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:47,150
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen...

544
00:41:47,233 --> 00:41:48,694
murderers.

545
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:52,114
- Which are you?
- Armourer's apprentice.

546
00:41:53,574 --> 00:41:57,286
But my master got sick of me, so...
here l am.

547
00:41:57,326 --> 00:42:00,496
[Yoren] Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

548
00:42:00,706 --> 00:42:03,916
lt's a thousand leagues from here
to the Wall!

549
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,460
And winter is coming!

550
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:39,286
Ham.

551
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:44,248
How many days in a row must a man
be expected to start his day with ham?

552
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,127
Bring me some beer at least.

553
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:51,172
You look exhausted.

554
00:42:51,297 --> 00:42:53,299
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

555
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:58,846
Don't look so terrified.

556
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:01,599
lf we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

557
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:04,436
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

558
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,898
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

559
00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:10,650
Honour made you leave,

560
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:12,444
honour brought you back.

561
00:43:13,487 --> 00:43:15,489
My friends brought me back.

562
00:43:16,406 --> 00:43:18,574
l didn't say it was your honour.

563
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:23,329
- They killed my father.
- And you're gonna bring him back to life?

564
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:25,581
No? Good.

565
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:28,418
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

566
00:43:29,543 --> 00:43:34,215
Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are
reporting whole villages abandoned.

567
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:37,386
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

568
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:39,637
from dusk until dawn.

569
00:43:39,721 --> 00:43:44,183
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

570
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:47,853
to what ends the gods only know.

571
00:43:48,855 --> 00:43:51,275
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men

572
00:43:51,357 --> 00:43:53,610
discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

573
00:43:53,735 --> 00:43:57,781
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

574
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:05,538
Do you think your brother's war
is more important than ours?

575
00:44:06,873 --> 00:44:07,873
No.

576
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,795
When dead men and worse
come hunting for us in the night,

577
00:44:11,878 --> 00:44:15,799
do you think it matters
who sits on the Iron Throne?

578
00:44:16,632 --> 00:44:18,969
- No.
- Good.

579
00:44:19,094 --> 00:44:21,721
Because l want you
and your wolf with us

580
00:44:21,846 --> 00:44:24,766
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

581
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:27,476
Beyond the Wall?

582
00:44:27,603 --> 00:44:30,605
l'll not sit meekly by...
and wait for the snows.

583
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,650
l mean to find out what's happening.

584
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,695
The Night's Watch will ride in force

585
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:40,991
against the wildlings, the white walkers
and whatever else is out there.

586
00:44:41,157 --> 00:44:42,617
[Men shouting]

587
00:44:43,826 --> 00:44:46,371
[Mormont] And we will find Benjen Stark,

588
00:44:46,496 --> 00:44:48,040
alive or dead.

589
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:51,208
l will command them myself.

590
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:54,880
So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

591
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,840
[Man] Move out!

592
00:44:56,924 --> 00:44:59,550
[Mormont] ..are you a brother of
the Night's Watch

593
00:44:59,634 --> 00:45:03,262
or a bastard boy
who wants to play at war?

594
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,007
ls this your command, Khaleesi?

595
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:49,558
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs
in the Night Lands.

596
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:54,773
Sell them. You can return to the free cities
and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

597
00:45:54,898 --> 00:45:56,942
They were not given to me to sell.

598
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,534
Khaleesi, my Queen...

599
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:09,121
l vow to serve you, obey you,

600
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:11,123
to die for you if need be...

601
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,543
but let him go, Khaleesi.

602
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:16,837
l know what you intend. Do not.

603
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,630
l must.

604
00:46:19,715 --> 00:46:21,882
[Sighs] You don't understand...

605
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:25,929
Don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

606
00:46:26,054 --> 00:46:27,806
l won't watch you burn.

607
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,476
ls that what you fear?

608
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:52,956
You will be my khalasar.

609
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:57,168
l see the faces of slaves.

610
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,670
l free you.

611
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:04,717
Take off your collars.
Go if you wish, no one will stop you.

612
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,344
But if you stay...

613
00:47:07,346 --> 00:47:10,974
it will be as brothers and sisters,

614
00:47:11,058 --> 00:47:13,351
as husbands and wives.

615
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:21,652
[Chuckles softly]

616
00:47:25,112 --> 00:47:27,574
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.

617
00:47:30,284 --> 00:47:32,161
You swore to obey me.

618
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,418
[Grunting]

619
00:47:41,255 --> 00:47:44,132
l am Daenerys Stormborn...

620
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:47,052
of House Targaryen...

621
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:49,054
of the blood of old Valyria.

622
00:47:49,137 --> 00:47:51,931
l am the Dragon's Daughter.

623
00:47:52,056 --> 00:47:54,393
And l swear to you...

624
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:58,230
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

625
00:47:58,355 --> 00:48:01,023
- You will not hear me scream.
- l will.

626
00:48:03,819 --> 00:48:05,862
But it is not your screams l want.

627
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:08,949
Only your life.

628
00:48:35,516 --> 00:48:37,226
[Singing]

629
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:50,157
[Wailing]

630
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:54,076
[Mirri screaming]

631
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:10,384
[Screaming continues]

632
00:49:40,123 --> 00:49:41,791
[Chirruping]

633
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:30,882
[Soft snarls]

634
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:41,310
Blood of my blood.

635
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:45,063
[Hisses]

636
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,750
[Hisses]

637
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:16,261
[Shrieking]

638
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:26,188
[Shrieking continues]

639
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:33,188

''Arrive within the fortnight

10
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,304
Poor Ned Stark.

11
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,889
Brave man, terrible judgment.

12
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,188
Attacking him was stupid.

13
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,277
[Grunts]

14
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,823
Lannisters...

15
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,408
don't act like fools.

16
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,459
Are you going to say something clever?

17
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,379
Go on, say something clever.

18
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,425
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

19
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,015
- Why is he still alive?
- Tyrion?

20
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,811
Ned Stark.

21
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,645
One of our men interfered,

22
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,024
speared him through the leg
before l could finish him.

23
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,235
Why is he still alive?

24
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,406
lt wouldn't have been clean.

25
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,949
Clean.

26
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:24,329
You spend too much time worrying
about what other people think of you.

27
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,455
l could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

28
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,626
That's what you want
people to think of you.

29
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,961
lt's the truth.

30
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,882
When you hear them whispering
''kingslayer'' behind your back,

31
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,966
doesn't it bother you?

32
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,305
Of course it bothers me.

33
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,307
A lion doesn't concern himself

34
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,391
with the opinions of the sheep.

35
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,563
l suppose l should be grateful
that your vanity

36
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,733
got in the way
of your recklessness.

37
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,987
l'm giving you half of our forces -

38
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,489
30,OOO men.

39
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,326
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's
girlhood home

40
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,829
and remind her that Lannisters

41
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,872
pay their debts.

42
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:12,127
l didn't realise you placed such
a high value on my brother's life.

43
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,670
He's a Lannister.

44
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:18,132
He might be the lowest of the Lannisters,
but he's one of us.

45
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,677
And every day that he remains a prisoner,

46
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,680
the less our name commands respect.

47
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,848
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinions of...

48
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,351
No, that's not an opinion. It's a fact.

49
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,356
lf another house
can seize one of our own

50
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,067
and hold him captive with impunity,

51
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,444
we are no longer a house to be feared.

52
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,034
Your mother's dead.

53
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,286
Before long l'll be dead.

54
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,206
And you...

55
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,500
and your brother
and your sister

56
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,125
and all of her children.

57
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:57,505
All of us dead,
all of us rotting in the ground.

58
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,050
lt's the family name that lives on.

59
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,553
lt's all that lives on.

60
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,723
Not your personal glory,
not your honour,

61
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,684
but family.

62
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,853
Do you understand?

63
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,858
Hmm.

64
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,742
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

65
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:31,038
You're blessed to belong to the most
powerful family in the Kingdoms.

66
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,875
And you're still blessed with youth.

67
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,461
And what have you done
with these blessings, huh?

68
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,048
You've served as a glorified
bodyguard for two kings -

69
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,636
one a madman,
the other a drunk.

70
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,644
The future of our family will be determined
in these next few months.

71
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,816
We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.

72
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,319
Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.

73
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,035
l need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.

74
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,331
Not next year. Not tomorrow.

75
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,999
Now.

76
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,939
[Bell tolling]

77
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,987
You're in pain.

78
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,038
l've had worse, my lady.

79
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,415
Perhaps it's time to go home.

80
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,334
The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.

81
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,920
l know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

82
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,923
Do you, Lord Stark?

83
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,511
ls that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

84
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,055
Has he done this before?

85
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,562
Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

86
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,273
Your brother...

87
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,690
or your lover?

88
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,115
The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years

89
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,742
to keep bloodlines pure.

90
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,911
Jaime and l are more
than brother and sister.

91
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,163
We shared a womb.

92
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,125
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

93
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,127
My son saw you with him.

94
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,093
Do you love your children?

95
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,096
- With all my heart.
- No more than l love mine.

96
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,348
- And they're all Jaime's.
- [Chuckles] Thank the gods.

97
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,019
ln the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

98
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,937
l finish him off in other ways.

99
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,774
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

100
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,069
Hated him? l worshipped him.

101
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,908
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed
of him, but he was mine by oath.

102
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,952
And when l finally saw him
on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,

103
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,788
lean and fierce and black-bearded,

104
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,081
it was the happiest moment of my life.

105
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,002
That night he crawled on top of me,
stinking of wine,

106
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,963
and did what he did,
what little he could do,

107
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,218
and whispered in my ear, ''Lyanna.''

108
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,639
Your sister was a corpse
and l was a living girl

109
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,767
and he loved her more than me.

110
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,313
When the king returns from his hunt,
l'll tell him the truth.

111
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,650
You must be gone by then -
you and your children.

112
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,445
l will not have
their blood on my hands.

113
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,989
Go as far away as you can,

114
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,325
with as many men as you can.

115
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,786
Because wherever you go,

116
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,163
Robert's wrath will follow you.

117
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,999
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

118
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,376
You should have taken the realm for yourself.

119
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,337
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

120
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,258
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

121
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,717
All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.

122
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,471
Such a sad mistake.

123
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,099
l've made many mistakes in my life...

124
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,768
but that wasn't one of them.

125
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,436
Oh, but it was.

126
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,773
When you play the game of thrones,
you win.. .

127
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,316
or you die.

128
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,318
There is no middle ground.

129
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,453
- [Children laughing]
- Come here.

130
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,542
[Children crying]

131
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,130
[Dog barking]

132
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,721
[Woman moaning]

133
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,764
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

134
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,975
[Woman laughs and moans]

135
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,061
Oh!

136
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,065
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

137
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,153
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh!

138
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,822
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

139
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,450
Oh!

140
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,411
No, no, no, no!

141
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,831
ls that what they teach you
up in the North?

142
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,586
And you -
wherever you're from -

143
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,631
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

144
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,135
Either of you understand
a thing that l'm saying?

145
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,931
Yes, my lord.

146
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,307
Let's start over, shall we?

147
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,852
You be the man...

148
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,938
and you be the woman.

149
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,818
Well, go ahead.

150
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,448
Slowly.

151
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,785
[Soft moaning]

152
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,918
You're not fooling them.
They just paid you.

153
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,462
They know what you are.

154
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,673
They know it's all just an act.

155
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,552
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

156
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,761
Now, that takes time.

157
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,557
You need to...

158
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,600
ease into it.

159
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,770
Go ahead.

160
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,524
Ease into it.

161
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,120
He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.

162
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,038
You're starting to like this.

163
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,040
He wants to believe you.

164
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,086
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old
enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?

165
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:55,381
He knows he's better
than other men.

166
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,927
He's always known it deep down inside.
Now he has proof.

167
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,554
He's so good,

168
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,393
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there,

169
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,104
overcoming your very nature.

170
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,442
Why don't you join us, my lord?

171
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,070
l'm saving myself for another.

172
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,697
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

173
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,825
- A stupid saying.
- [Moans]

174
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,952
What we don't know is usually
what gets us killed.

175
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,413
[Moans]

176
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,456
She must be very beautiful.

177
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,251
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines though.

178
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,337
l do believe my lord's in love.

179
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,841
For many years.
Most of my life, really.

180
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,176
Play with her arse.

181
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,427
And she loved me too.

182
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,974
l was her little confidant, her plaything.

183
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,061
She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

184
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:53,023
She told me about all the horses
that she liked,

185
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,442
the castle that she wanted to live in

186
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,445
and the man that she wanted to marry -

187
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,822
a Northerner...
with a jaw like an anvil.

188
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,076
- [Moaning]
- So l challenged him to a duel.

189
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,995
l mean, why not?
l'd read all the stories.

190
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:11,792
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

191
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:16,337
ln the end,
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

192
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,881
''He's just a boy,'' she said.

193
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,926
''Please don't hurt him.''

194
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,764
So he gave me a nice little scar
to remember him by, and off they went.

195
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,599
ls she still married to him?

196
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,644
Oh, no. He got himself killed
before the wedding...

197
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,645
[Gasping loudly]

198
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,524
..and she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive specimen.

199
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,235
She loves him, l'm afraid.

200
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,905
And why wouldn't she?
l mean, who could compare to him?

201
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,241
- He's just so...
- [Shrieks and moans]

202
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,119
[Moaning]
[Laughs]

203
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,831
[Moaning, sighing]

204
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,749
..good.

205
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,754
Do you know what l learned,
Iosing that duel?

206
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,091
l learned that l'll never win, not that way.

207
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,094
That's their game,

208
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,763
their rules.

209
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,849
l'm not going to fight them.

210
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,144
l'm going to fuck them.
That's what l know.

211
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,395
That's what l am.

212
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,356
And only by admitting what we are
can we get what we want.

213
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,777
And what do you want?

214
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,447
Oh, everything, my dear.

215
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,408
Everything there is.

216
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,413
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.

217
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,463
Hmm.

218
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,437
[Footsteps]

219
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,947
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

220
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:12,745
Where l come from,
we don't show mercy to criminals.

221
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,542
Where l come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord...

222
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,919
at low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,

223
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,923
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

224
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,551
The sea would come in
closer and closer.

225
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:29,263
You'd see death creeping towards you
a few inches at a time.

226
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,392
Where is it you come from?

227
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,601
The Iron Islands.

228
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,769
They far away?

229
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,273
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

230
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,025
Trust me, you've never heard
where l'm from neither.

231
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,488
''Trust me, my lord.''

232
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,618
You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

233
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,995
ln civilised lands,
you refer to your betters

234
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,206
by their proper titles.

235
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,959
- And what's that?
- Lord.

236
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,918
Why?

237
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,672
Why?

238
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,716
What do you mean, why?

239
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,052
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

240
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,761
What's that got to do with you?

241
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,724
lf your father's lord,

242
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,725
how can you be lord too?

243
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,313
- l will be lord after my father.
- So you're not lord now?

244
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,274
No, you...

245
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,153
Are you having a go at me?
Is that it?

246
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,072
l just don't understand
how you southerners do things.

247
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,451
- l'm not a southerner.
- You're from south of the Wall.

248
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,621
That makes you a southerner to me.

249
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,585
You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

250
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,462
Couldn't say, my lord.

251
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,506
Don't know what ''impunent'' means.

252
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,509
lmpudent.

253
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,970
lt means rude, disrespectful.

254
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,268
Do you want to lose that chain?

255
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,648
Theon Greyjoy!

256
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,192
The lady is our guest.

257
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,193
l thought she was our prisoner.

258
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,948
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

259
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,377
Chances are l won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

260
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,255
l'm used to worse than him.

261
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,381
Hmm?

262
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,217
l'm used to men who could
chew that boy up

263
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,760
and pick their teeth with his bones.

264
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,429
[Chuckles]

265
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,352
Why did you come here?

266
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,436
Didn't mean to come here.

267
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,440
Meant to get much further south than this.

268
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,442
As far south as south goes,

269
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,653
before the long night comes.

270
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,575
Why? What are you afraid of?

271
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,744
There's things that sleep in the day
and hunt at night.

272
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,458
- Owls and shadowcats...
- l'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.

273
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,048
The things you speak of -

274
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,676
they've been gone
for thousands of years.

275
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,636
They wasn't gone, old man.

276
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,515
They was sleeping.

277
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,144
And they ain't sleeping no more.

278
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,779
[Samwell] l miss girls.

279
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,616
Not even talking to them.
l never talked to them.

280
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,203
Just looking at them,

281
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,872
hearing them giggle.

282
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,587
Don't you miss girls?

283
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,844
Riders.

284
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,306
The horn.
We have to blow the horn.

285
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,601
Why is he alone?

286
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,980
One blast for a ranger returning,

287
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,856
two for wildlings,

288
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,108
- three for...
- There's no rider.

289
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,785
[Creaking]

290
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,623
[Neighs, snorts]

291
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,057
[Neighs]

292
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,352
- [Neighs]
- Whoa, boy, whoa.

293
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,563
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.

294
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,023
[Neighing continues]

295
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,698
Where's my uncle?

296
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,411
Ned!

297
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,207
lt's Robert.
We were hunting...

298
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,084
a boar...

299
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,428
[Robert] l should have
spent more time with you,

300
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,263
shown you how to be a man.

301
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,103
l was never meant to be a father.

302
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,500
Go on.

303
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,711
You don't want to see this.

304
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,935
My fault.

305
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,396
Too much wine,
missed my thrust.

306
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,909
[Robert] It stinks.

307
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,203
lt stinks like death.

308
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,123
Don't think l can't smell it.

309
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,333
[Robert laughs]

310
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:35,586
l paid the bastard back, Ned.

311
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:39,007
l drove my knife
right through his brain.

312
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,551
You ask 'em if l didn't. Ask 'em!

313
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:47,598
l want the funeral feast to be
the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.

314
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,270
And l want everyone
to taste the boar that got me.

315
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:59,236
Now leave us, the lot of you.
l need to talk to Ned.

316
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,489
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out, all of you!

317
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,782
[Coughing]

318
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,179
You damned fool.

319
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,471
Paper and ink on the table.

320
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,849
Write down what l say.

321
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:41,486
''ln the name of Robert

You know how it goes.

324
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,075
Fill in the damn titles.

325
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,243
''l hereby command

Give it over.

At least they'll say l did this right,

this one thing.

337
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,474
You'll rule now.

No one to tell me ''no'' but you.

Only you.

Let her live.

356
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,957
murdered by a pig.

[Wheezes, coughs]

358
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:06,173
Give me something for the pain
and let me die.

359
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,022
Give him milk of the poppy.

360
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,075
He was reeling from the wine.

361
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,785
[Door closes]

362
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,869
He commanded us to...

363
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:38,288
step aside, but...

364
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:41,541
l failed him.

365
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,547
No man could have
protected him from himself.

366
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:50,384
l wonder, Ser Barristan,

367
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:53,302
who gave the king this wine?

368
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,432
His squire,
from the king's own skin.

369
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,184
His squire? The Lannister boy?

370
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,438
Such a dutiful boy
to make sure His Grace

371
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,982
did not lack refreshment.

372
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:09,569
l do hope the poor lad
does not blame himself.

373
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:21,289
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

374
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:26,127
Whatever arrangements you made...

375
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,673
unmake them. At once.

376
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,093
l'm afraid those birds have flown.

377
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,262

My brother was a fool, l know,

Have l said something funny, ser?

408

Forgive me, Khaleesi,
but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror

409
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,802
didn't seize six of the Kingdoms
because they were his right.

410
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,763
He had no right to them.
He seized them because he could.

l'm afraid l am not worthy of the vintage.

467
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:14,518

who would drink up his own wares.

lt's the steward's life for me.

498
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,503
There's honour in being a steward.

499
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,005
Not much, really.

500
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,590
But there's food.

501
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,474

00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:25,083
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your uncle did.

521
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,251
Yes, my lord.

522
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:29,253
You'll find a weirwood
a mile north of the Wall.

523
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:32,173
And your old gods too, maybe.

524
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,260
My lord, might l go as well?

525
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,222
Does House Tarly keep the old gods?

526
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,641
No, my lord.

527
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:43,309
l was named in the light of the Seven,

528
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,938
as my father was
and his father before him.

529
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:49,942
Why would you forsake the gods
of your father and your House?

530
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,195
The Night's Watch is my House now.

531
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,822
The Seven have never answered my prayers.

532
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:00,244
Perhaps the old gods will.

533
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,079
As you wish, lad.

534
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:07,041
You've all been assigned an order,

535
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,961
according to our needs

536
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,755
and your strengths.

537
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,715
Halder to the builders.

538
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,469
Pyp to the stewards.

539
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:20,429
Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.

540
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,474
Samwell to the stewards.

541
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:26,143
Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.

542
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,230
Balian to the rangers.

543
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,856
Rast to the rangers.

544
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,567
Jon to the stewards.

545
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:33,402
Rancer to the builder.

546
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:36,405
Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards.

547
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:39,867
Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.

548
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:42,994
Vorkoy to the builders.
Joby to the stables.

549
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,331
Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.

550
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:48,750
Nelugo to the rangers.

551
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:52,378
May all the gods preserve you.

552
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,677
Rangers with me.

553
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,306
Builders!

554
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:25,871
Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.

555
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:29,916
Pyp, you will report
to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

556
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:34,713
Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe
in the stables.

557
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,675
Dareon, we are sending you
to Eastwatch.

558
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,594
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

559
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:44,847
Make no comment about his nose.

560
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:49,101
Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Mormont

561
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:52,188
has requested you
for his personal steward.

562
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,902
Will l serve the Lord Commander's meals
and fetch hot water for his bath?

563
00:37:57,068 --> 00:38:00,780
Certainly. And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,

564
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:03,699
change his sheets
and blankets daily

565
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,496
and do everything else
the Lord Commander requires of you.

566
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:12,041
Do you take me for a servant?

567
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,753
We took you for a man
of the Night's Watch.

568
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:17,672
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

569
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:21,342
- May l go?
- As you wish.

570
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:31,103
Jon, wait! Don't you see
what they're doing?

571
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,105
l see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

572
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,981
He wanted it and he got it.

573
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,568
Stewards are nothing but maids!

574
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,695
l'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of you!

575
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:42,822
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

576
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:45,909
l was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall

577
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:48,954
when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

578
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:52,875
l pushed him away and he said he'd have
my hands cut off for stealing their silver.

579
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,793
So now l'm here -
at the end of the world

580
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:57,670
with no one to sing for
but old men and little shits like you.

581
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,672
l'll never see my family again.

582
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:01,884
l'll never be inside a woman again.

583
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,135
So don't tell me about fair.

584
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:07,054
l thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.

585
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:11,268
Think l was gonna tell a bunch of strangers
that a high lord tried to grab my cock?

586
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,398
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
l'd like to hear a song.

587
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:24,197
Now listen to me.

588
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:27,576
The old man is the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

589
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:29,494
You'll be with him day and night.

590
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:32,079
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

591
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:36,001
But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,

592
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:38,003
squire for him in battle.

593
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:41,715
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

594
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,425
And he asked for you himself.

595
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:47,262
He wants to groom you for command.

596
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,018
l just...

597
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:57,063
l always wanted to be a ranger.

598
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,318
l always wanted to be a wizard.

599
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,697
- [Laughs]
- What?

600
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:08,032
No, l'm serious.

601
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,702
So you'll stay
and say your words with me?

602
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,545
Lord Stark...a moment.

603
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,757
Alone, if you will.

604
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,393
He named you Protector of the Realm.

605
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:38,646
He did.

606
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,398
She won't care.

607
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:43,943
Give me an hour and l can put
a hundred swords at your command.

608
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:45,820
And what should l do
with a hundred swords?

609
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:49,782
Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

610
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:53,327
We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.

611
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:57,248
Protector of the Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

612
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,420
Every moment you delay gives Cersei
another moment to prepare.

613
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,422
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

614
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:06,300
What about Stannis?

615
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:09,635
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering them to Stannis?

616
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:12,431
You have odd notions
about protecting the realm.

617
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:14,182
Stannis is your older brother.

618
00:41:14,307 --> 00:41:16,434
This isn't about the bloody
line of succession.

619
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:20,646
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.

620
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:24,735
What's best for the Kingdoms?

621
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:27,737
What's best for the people we rule?

622
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:31,407
We all know what Stannis is.

623
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:34,786
He inspires no love or loyalty.

624
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:36,579
He's not a king.

625
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,291
l am.

626
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,882
Stannis is a commander.

627
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,135
He's led men into war twice.

628
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,971
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.

629
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,891
Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that. So was Robert.

630
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:58,309
Tell me something.

631
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,811
Do you still believe good soldiers
make good kings?

632
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,280
l will not dishonour Robert's last hours
by shedding blood in his halls...

633
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,824
and dragging frightened children
from their beds.

634
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:30,132
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

635
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,885
You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.

636
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:36,347
Not his steward...

637
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:39,768
not his captain of the guard...

638
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:42,144
and not his wife.

639
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,860
Only Stannis himself.

640
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:51,864
- [Knocking]
- Yes, my lord.

641
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:55,576
Now leave us.

642
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:07,378
My Lord Protector.

643
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,969
The king has no trueborn sons.

644
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:17,556
Joffrey and Tommen...

645
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:19,599
are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

646
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:25,105
- So when the king dies...
- The throne passes to his brother...

647
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,025
Lord Stannis.

648
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:30,360
So it would seem.

649
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:34,447
- Unless...
- There is no ''unless''.

650
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:36,867
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

651
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:39,077
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

652
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:43,206
You would be wise to deny it to him
and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

653
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:48,878
Do you have a shred of honour?

654
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:52,798
You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.

655
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:55,092
All of the power is yours.
You need only...

656
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,721
reach out and take it.

657
00:43:57,887 --> 00:43:59,931
Make peace with the Lannisters.

658
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:03,476
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

659
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:06,313
We've plenty of time to get rid of Stannis,

660
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:09,858
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he comes into his throne,

661
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,235
we simply reveal his little secret

662
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:15,447
- and seat Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

663
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:19,367
You'll need someone to share these burdens,
l assure you.

664
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:21,536
My price would be modest.

665
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:24,664
What you suggest is treason.

666
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:26,875
Only if we lose.

667
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:32,213
Make peace with the Lannisters,
you say.. .

668
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:35,800
with the people who tried to murder my boy.

669
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,387
We only make peace
with our enemies, my lord.

670
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:41,722
That's why it's called ''making peace''.

671
00:44:41,806 --> 00:44:45,059
No. l won't do it.

672
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,688
So it will be Stannis and war?

673
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,981
There is no other choice.

674
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:52,442
He is the heir.

675
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:55,027
So why did you call me here?

676
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:57,239
Not for my wisdom, clearly.

677
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:00,951
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

678
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:03,871
The queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms -

679
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:07,833
enough to overwhelm what remains
of my household guard.

680
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,751
l need the gold cloaks.

681
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,045
The City Watch is 2,OOO strong...

682
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:16,300
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

683
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,762
Look at you.

684
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,931
You know what you want me to do,

685
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,059
you know it has to be done,

686
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,269
but it's not honourable, so...

687
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:30,771
the words stick in your throat.

688
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:33,900
When the queen proclaims one king

689
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:35,735
and the Hand proclaims another,

690
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,530
whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?

691
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,117
Who do they follow?

692
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,041

19
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:41,629
你妹妹很清楚我们今天要走.
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.

20
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:43,831
- 她怎么会忘记... - 她没有忘记.
- How she could forget-- - She didn't forget.

21
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,567
她跟她的舞蹈老师在一起. 每天早上都是.
She's with her dancing master. She's with him every morning.

22
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:49,138
她总是带着满身瘀伤回来. 她真是笨手笨脚.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises. She's so clumsy.

23
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,073
<i>别出声!
- ( Swords clanging ) - Hush!</i>

24
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:53,308
回你的房间去.
Go back to your room.

25
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:55,646
插上门闩
Bar the doors

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,881
绝不要给不认识的人开门.
and do not open them for anyone you do not know.

27
00:02:57,915 --> 00:03:00,584
- 怎么了? 出什么事了? - 照我说的做.
- What is it? What's happening? - Do as I told you.

28
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,419
快跑!
Run!

29
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:07,824
<i>这边!
Man: This way!</i>

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,328
<i>( Reaming )</i>

31
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:23,504
左, 右. 右!
Left, right. Rah!

32
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:25,240
现在你死了.
Now you are dead.

33
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:27,241
你说的是右边,
You said right,

34
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:29,144
但你打的却是左边.
but you went left.

35
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:31,378
结果你是个死女孩了.
And now you are a dead girl.

36
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:33,014
可是你骗人了.
Only 'cause you lied.

37
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,682
我的舌头骗人了. 可我的眼睛...
My tongue lied. My eyes

38
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,920
说的是真话. 只是你没看见.
shouted the truth. You were not seeing.

39
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:41,456
我明明看了, 但你...
I was so. I watched, but you--

40
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,960
看了不等于看见了, 死女孩.
watching is not seeing, dead girl.

41
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,665
只有看见, 只有真正的洞察,
The seeing, the true seeing,

42
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,135
才是剑术的精髓.
that is the heart of swordplay.

43
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,305
<i>( Door opens )</i>

44
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:00,144
艾莉亚史塔克, 跟我们走.
Arya Stark, come with us.

45
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:02,913
你父亲要见你.
Your father wants to see you.

46
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:05,316
可是为什么...
And why is it

47
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,784
艾德大人会派兰尼斯特家的人...
that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men

48
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:10,021
而不是他自己的手下来呢? 我很好奇.
in place of his own? I am wondering.

49
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:13,123
别不识好歹, 舞蹈老师.
Mind your place, dancing master.

50
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:15,693
<i>此事与你无关.
This is no concern of yours.</i>

51
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:17,562
我父亲才不会派你们来呢.
My father wouldn't send you.

52
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,800
而且我也不想跟你们走.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.

53
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:26,170
抓住她.
( Laughs ) Take her.

54
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:30,173
你们是人还是蛇, 居然威胁一个小孩子?
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?

55
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:32,343
给我滚开, 矮家伙.
Get out of my way, little man.

56
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:35,846
<i>我是西利欧佛瑞尔...
I am Syrio Forel...</i>

57
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,880
外国杂种.
Foreign bastard.

58
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:44,321
...你跟我讲话要放尊重点.
...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.

59
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:46,956
宰了这布拉佛斯人, 把那女孩抓来.
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

60
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:51,228
小艾莉亚, 今天我们的舞蹈课至此为止.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.

61
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:53,898
跑去找你父亲吧.
Run to your father.

62
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:17,122
该死的东西.
- Bloody oafs. - ( Sword rings )

63
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:19,024
快走, 艾莉亚.
Be gone now, Arya.

64
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:21,627
跟我一起走. 快跑.
Come with me. Run.

65
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:26,266
布拉佛斯的首席剑士从不临阵脱逃.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.

66
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,312
<i>记不记得我们应该
( Wood clatters )</i>

67
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,312
What do we say

68
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:42,281
怎么对死神说话?
to the God of death?

69
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:44,183
"今天不行."
Not today.

70
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,153
快走.
Go.

71
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,691
( Lannister men moaning )

72
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:59,963
<i>- ( Swords ringing ) - ( Men screaming )</i>

73
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:14,812
今天不行. 今天不行.
Not today. Not today.

74
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:20,218
( Gasps )

75
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:26,158
你不要过来.
Stay away from me.

76
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:27,858
我要告诉我父亲.
I'll tell my father.

77
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:30,862
我要... 我要告诉王后.
I'll-- I'll tell the Queen.

78
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:34,598
你以为是谁派我来的?
( Chuckles ) Who do you think sent me?

79
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:40,906
<i>( Horses neigh )</i>

80
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:48,980
缝衣针.
Needle.

81
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:54,252
原来她在这儿.
There she is.

82
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:56,553
- 你想要什么? - 我要抓你, 小狼女.
- What do you want? - I want you, wolf girl.

83
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:58,290
- 过来. - 不要过来.
- Come here. - Leave me be.

84
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:00,391
我父亲是首相. 他会奖赏你的.
My father's a lord. He'll reward you.

85
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:01,992
<i>会奖赏我的是王后!
She'll reward me-- the Queen!</i>

86
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:04,194
走开!
- Stay away! - ( Gasps )

87
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,608
<i>( Door clanging, creaking )</i>

88
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:36,928
史塔克大人, 你一定渴了.
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.

89
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:40,533
瓦里斯.
Varys.

90
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,637
我向你保证里面没有下毒.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.

91
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:48,608
为什么没人肯信任太监呢?
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?

92
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:58,920
不太多, 大人.
Not so much, My Lord.

93
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,988
如果我是你的话, 我会留下一点.
I would save the rest, if I were you.

94
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,892
藏好它. 在这地牢里常有人被渴死.
Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.

95
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:09,264
我的女儿们怎么样了?
What about my daughters?

96
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:11,834
小的那个看来已经逃出了红堡.
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.

97
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:14,069
连我的小小鸟们都找不到她.
Even my little birds cannot find her.

98
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:17,639
- 珊莎呢? - 依然是乔佛里的未婚妻.
- And Sansa? - Still engaged to Joffrey.

99
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:21,244
瑟曦会把她留在身边. 但你家其他的人...
Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though--

100
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:23,446
全死了, 我感到很痛心.
all dead, it grieves me to say.

101
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,747
我讨厌看到流血.
I do so hate the sight of blood.

102
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,119
我的手下被屠杀时你却袖手旁观.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.

103
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:32,455
我只能那样, 大人.
And would again, My Lord.

104
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:36,892
我既没武器, 又没盔甲, 还被兰尼斯特的武士团团围住.
I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.

105
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,260
你看我象个大英雄吗?
When you look at me do you see a hero?

106
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,568
究竟是什么疯狂念头让你去告诉王后...
What madness led you to tell the Queen

107
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:50,405
说你知道乔佛里的真实身世?
you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?

108
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:54,743
仁慈的疯狂念头.
The madness of mercy.

109
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:59,181
希望她能保住她孩子们的性命.
That she might save her children.

110
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:01,048
<i>啊, 孩子们.
Ah, the children.</i>

111
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,952
受苦的总是那些无辜者.
It is always the innocents who suffer.

112
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:06,888
杀死国王的不是那袋酒, 也不是那只野猪.
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.

113
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:10,392
酒令他反应迟缓, 野猪撕开了他的肚子,
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open,

114
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:13,660
但是真正杀死国王的却是你的仁慈.
but it was your mercy that killed the King.

115
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:20,600
我想你知道自己在劫难逃吧, 艾德大人?
I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?

116
00:09:25,338 --> 00:09:27,907
王后不会杀我.
The Queen can't kill me.

117
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,409
凯特还抓着她的弟弟.
Cat holds her brother.

118
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,145
可惜不是她爱的那个弟弟.
The wrong brother sadly.

119
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,914
而且这会儿也跑了.
And lost to her.

120
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,884
你夫人让小恶魔从她的指缝里钻了出去.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.

121
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:44,158
倘若真是这样,
If that's true,

122
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:47,727
那快快割了我的喉咙, 做个了结.
then slit my throat and be done with it.

123
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:50,331
今天不会, 大人.
Not today, My Lord.

124
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:56,203
告诉我, 瓦里斯.
Tell me something, Varys.

125
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,740
你究竟是为谁服务?
Who do you truly serve?

126
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:02,644
为了国家, 大人.
The Realm, My Lord.

127
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,947
总得有人为国家服务.
Someone must.

128
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:15,057
<i>( Door creaks, clangs )</i>

129
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:26,668
这是奥瑟, 肯定没错.
It's Othor, without a doubt.

130
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,604
另外那个是杰佛佛花, 大人,
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord,

131
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,407
<i>他的一只手被狼咬掉了.
less the hand the wolf tore off.</i>

132
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:35,443
有班扬或他手下其他人的踪迹吗?
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?

133
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:38,346
只有这两个, 大人.
Just these two, My Lord.

134
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,383
我看他们死了有一阵子了.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

135
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:43,153
- 嗯. - 可是气味...
- Mmm. - The smell.

136
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,524
( Sniffs )

137
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,158
怎么气味?
What smell?

138
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:51,229
没有气味.
There is none.

139
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,999
如果他们死了很久, 怎么还没腐烂?
If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?

140
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,735
我们烧了他们吧.
We should burn them.

141
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:00,804
雪诺说得没错, 大人. 烧掉尸体吧.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord. Fire will do for them.

142
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,006
野人的处理方式.
The Wildling way.

143
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,777
我要先让伊蒙师傅检查一下这些尸体.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.

144
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:08,980
你也许是个懦夫, 塔利,
You may be a coward, Tarly,

145
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:11,149
<i>但人倒是不笨.
but you're not stupid.</i>

146
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:15,219
- 把他们弄进去. - 照他说的做.
- Get them inside. - You heard him.

147
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:18,722
总司令,
Lord Commander,

148
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:21,259
伊蒙师傅正在等你过去...
Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers--

149
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:25,129
君临城来了一只渡鸦.
a raven from King's Landing.

150
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:27,030
快移出去.
Come on, move 'em out.

151
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,609
给我倒杯酒, 雪诺,
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

152
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:44,578
<i>再给你自己也倒一杯.
and pour one for yourself.</i>

153
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:56,957
国王死了.
The King is dead.

154
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,604
我父亲有什么消息?
Is there any word of my father?

155
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:13,873
坐下.
Sit.

156
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:20,912
史塔克大人...
Lord Stark has been

157
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:23,548
被控叛国.
charged with treason.

158
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:25,984
他们说他与劳勃的弟弟共谋
They say he conspired with Robert's brothers

159
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:28,754
阻止乔佛里王子继位.
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

160
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:44,740
<i>我希望你别打算做任何傻事.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.</i>

161
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:48,210
如今你的职责所在是这里.
Your duty lies here now.

162
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:51,312
我的妹妹也在君临.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.

163
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,750
我相信她们定会...
I'm sure they'll be

164
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:57,586
受到妥善照顾.
treated gently.

165
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:03,859
你的父亲犯下了严重的叛国罪.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.

166
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:07,363
劳勃国王尸骨未寒
King Robert's body was still warm

167
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:11,667
艾德大人就密谋夺取乔佛里的王位.
when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

168
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,070
他绝不会做这种事.
He wouldn't do that.

169
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:16,972
他知道我有多爱乔佛里. 他绝不会.
He knows how much I love Joffrey. He wouldn't.

170
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:20,110
求求您, 王后陛下, 这一定是误会.
Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.

171
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:23,780
找我父亲过来. 他会向您解释... 他是国王的朋友.
Send for my father. He'll tell you-- the King was his friend.

172
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:26,884
亲爱的珊莎, 你是完全无辜的. 我们都明白.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong. We know that.

173
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:30,419
<i>但你毕竟是个叛国者的女儿.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.</i>

174
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:32,621
我怎么敢让你嫁给我儿子呢?
How can I allow you to marry my son?

175
00:13:32,657 --> 00:13:35,825
<i>叛国者的种必有背叛之性...
Pycelle: A child born of a traitor's seed</i>

176
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:38,192
不适合陪伴我们的国王.
is no fit consort for our King.

177
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,861
<i>眼下她是个可爱的好孩子, 陛下,
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,</i>

178
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:43,364
可十年以后谁知道...
but in 10 years who knows

179
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:45,365
她会否同样犯下背叛罪行呢?
what treasons she may hatch?

180
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,469
不, 我不是. 我一定会成为他的好妻子.
No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.

181
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:53,073
我会成为象您一样的好王后, 我保证. 我绝不会做任何错事.
I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise. I won't hatch anything.

182
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:57,077
这孩子是无辜的, 陛下.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

183
00:13:57,113 --> 00:14:00,914
应该给她一个机会, 来证明她的忠诚.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.

184
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,188
( Huffs )

185
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:10,125
可爱的小鸽子, 你得写信给凯特琳夫人
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn

186
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,494
以及你的大哥, 他叫什么名字?
and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?

187
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:14,263
罗柏.
Robb.

188
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:17,066
你父亲被捕的消息很快就会传到他那里.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.

189
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,501
所以最好由你来告诉他.
Best it comes from you.

190
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:21,904
如果你想救你父亲,
If you would help your father,

191
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:24,375
就必须敦促你大哥维护王国的和平.
urge your brother to keep the King's peace.

192
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:28,312
叫他前来君临向乔佛里宣誓效忠.
Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

193
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:37,953
或许... 如果我可以见见我父亲, 和他谈谈...
If-- if I could see my father, talk to him about--

194
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:43,926
你太令我失望了, 孩子.
You disappoint me, child.

195
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,260
我们已经告诉过你令尊的罪行.
We have told you of your father's treason.

196
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:48,462
为何你还想要见一个叛徒?
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?

197
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:50,764
我只是想知道...
I only meant that--

198
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:54,802
他会被如何处置?
what will happen to him?

199
00:14:56,404 --> 00:15:00,206
- 这要看情况. - 看什么... 情况?
- That depends. - On-- on what?

200
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,109
看你的大哥...
On your brother.

201
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:07,480
还有你会如何做.
And on you.

202
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:17,993
叛国?
Treason?

203
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:20,162
这信是珊莎写的?
Sansa wrote this?

204
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:22,565
是你妹妹的笔迹, 但其实是王后的言辞.
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.

205
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:26,701
召你去君临向新王宣誓效忠.
You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.

206
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,838
乔佛里囚禁了我父亲, 还想要我对他效忠?
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?

207
00:15:29,873 --> 00:15:33,375
这是王室的谕令, 大人.
This is a royal command, My Lord.

208
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:36,879
- 如果你拒绝服从... - 我不会拒绝.
- If you should refuse to obey-- - I won't refuse.

209
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:39,682
既然国王陛下召我去君临,
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,

210
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:42,150
那我会去君临的.
I'll go to King's Landing.

211
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:44,919
但不是一个人去.
But not alone.

212
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:48,756
立刻召集封臣.
Call the banners.

213
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,125
召集全部吗, 大人?
All of them, My Lord?

214
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,032
他们全都发过誓要保卫我父亲, 是吧?
They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?

215
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:55,256
是的.
They have.

216
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,432
现在就让我们看看他们能否信守誓言吧.
Now we see what their words are worth.

217
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:01,702
好吧.
Yeah.

218
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:12,346
你感到害怕吗?
Are you afraid?

219
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,884
我是感到害怕.
I must be.

220
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,087
很好.
Good.

221
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:21,155
为什么这很好?
Why is that good?

222
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:23,491
这说明你并不愚蠢.
It means you're not stupid.

223
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:28,629
( Cawing )

224
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:48,783
你在清早就收到这封信了?
You've had this since dawn?

225
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:52,386
信是发给我的, 而不是给你的.
He sent it to me, not you.

226
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:54,855
我只是出于礼貌才给你看.
I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.

227
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,758
出于礼貌?!
A courtesy?!

228
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,793
我的丈夫被囚禁.
My husband has been taken prisoner.

229
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:00,461
我的儿子准备宣战.
My son intends to declare war.

230
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:02,364
宣战?
A war?

231
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,799
你儿子要对兰尼斯特家开战?
Your son against the Lannisters?

232
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:09,203
你应该赶去他那里. 叫他保持耐心.
You should go to him. Teach him patience.

233
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:12,406
奈德在地牢里等死, 你还说要保持耐心?
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?

234
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:15,144
他是你的姐夫!
He is your brother by law!

235
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:18,047
难道家族对你来说毫无意义吗?
Does family mean nothing to you?

236
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,950
家族对我来说意味着一切.
Family means everything to me.

237
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:23,419
我绝不会拿罗宾的性命来冒险
And I will not risk Robin's life

238
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:25,922
卷入另一场跟你丈夫有关的战争.
to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.

239
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:28,857
- 我饿了. - 安静, 亲爱的.
- I'm hungry. - Hush now, darling.

240
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:31,093
你刚刚吃过呀.
You just ate.

241
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:33,962
那你不会支持我们了? 你是这个意思吗?
You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?

242
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:37,833
- 可我就是饿了! - 快了, 亲爱的, 快了.
- But I'm hungry! - Soon, love, soon.

243
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:42,171
这儿永远欢迎你, 姐姐.
You're always welcome here, sister.

244
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:45,207
但如果你想要我派兵离开艾林谷去参战...
But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight--

245
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,442
我就是想要你这样做.
That is what I ask.

246
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:52,280
亲爱的. 你该洗澡了.
Go on, sweet. Time for your bath.

247
00:17:52,315 --> 00:17:54,916
洗过澡我就喂你吃.
I'll feed you after.

248
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,592
如果你担心你儿子的安危...
If you fear for the safety of your son--

249
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,294
我当然担心我儿子的安危!
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!

250
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:07,829
你当我是白痴吗?
Are you an idiot?

251
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:10,266
他们谋杀了我丈夫.
They killed my husband.

252
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,734
<i>你说他们还把你儿子从窗口抛下去.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.</i>

253
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:15,304
那些人什么都干得出来.
These people will do anything.

254
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:17,404
所以我们必须阻止他们.
And that is why we have to stop them.

255
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,978
谷地的骑士将留在谷地
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale

256
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:27,748
他们属于这里, 他们得保护他们的领主.
where they belong, to protect their Lord.

257
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:36,191
( Whistling a tune )

258
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:44,567
你能不能闭嘴?
Will you shut up?

259
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:48,704
这一带到处是山地部落.
There's hill tribes all around here.

260
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,208
如果我真的要死了,
If I'm going to die,

261
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:53,576
我宁愿哼着歌去死.
it may as well be with a song in my heart.

262
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:56,847
我可以抢走你的食物并把你丢在这里.
I should just take your food and leave you here.

263
00:18:56,882 --> 00:19:00,151
嗯? 那时候你会怎样?
Eh? What would you do then?

264
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:03,020
八成会被饿死.
Starve, most likely.

265
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:04,888
你觉得我不会这么做, 是吗?
You don't think I'd do it, do you?

266
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:09,426
你想要什么, 波隆? 金子? 女人?
What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women?

267
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:12,364
多金的女人?
Golden women?

268
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:14,599
跟着我, 你要什么有什么,
Stick with me and you'll have them all,

269
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:17,468
只要有我在, 你很快就能得到你想要的.
for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.

270
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:20,770
你知道这一点.
But you knew that.

271
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:24,374
所以你才会如此勇敢地为维护我的荣誉而出战.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.

272
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:28,578
很公平.
Fair enough.

273
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:31,148
但别指望我会对你卑躬屈膝...
But don't go looking for me to bend the knee

274
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:33,751
对你说话时满口老爷大人.
and "My Lord" you every time you take a shit.

275
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:37,055
我不当你的仆人, 也不当你的朋友.
I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.

276
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:40,292
但我珍视你的友谊,
Though I would treasure your friendship,

277
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,929
我主要看重你杀人的身手.
I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.

278
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:46,366
而要是哪天真有人引诱你出卖我,
And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out,

279
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,134
请你记住:
remember this:

280
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,038
不管他们出价多少, 我都能出更多给你.
Whatever their price, I'll beat it.

281
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:53,173
我很爱惜我这条命.
I like living.

282
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:55,709
( Whistles )

283
00:19:57,778 --> 00:20:01,615
<i>提利昂.
- ( Rustling ) - ( Bronn whispers ) Tyrion.</i>

284
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:04,451
提利昂.
Tyrion.

285
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:10,490
提利昂.
Tyrion.

286
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,660
<i>( Birds chirp, flutter )</i>

287
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,883
过来一起烤烤火吧.
Come, share our fire.

288
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,684
再尝尝我们的山羊肉.
Help yourselves to our goat.

289
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,960
当你去见你的神的时候, 告诉他们
When you meet your Gods, you tell them

290
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:48,929
是石鸦部落的多夫之子夏嘎...
Shagga Son of Dolf

291
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:52,332
送你上路的.

292
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:55,769
我是兰尼斯特部落的泰温之子提利昂.
I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.

293
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:58,838
你想要怎么个死法, 泰温之子提利昂?
How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?

294
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,009
我想活到八十岁死在自己的床上
In my own bed, at the age of 80

295
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:05,912
喝饱一肚子酒, 还有个姑娘在下面给我吹萧.
with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.

296

( All laughing )

298
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:14,320
把那半人抓起来.
Take the half man.

299
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:17,123
可以让他给孩子们跳舞. 把另外那家伙宰了.
He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.

300
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:19,259
不不不不不!
No no no no no!

301
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:22,362
我的家族既有钱又有势.
My-- my House is rich and powerful.

302
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:25,064
只要你们保我们平安出山,
If you see us through these mountains,

303
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:27,067
我父亲赏你们的金子会多到可以拿来洗澡.
my father will shower you with gold.

304
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,135
我们才不相信半人的承诺.
We have no use for a half man's promises.

305
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,740
我虽然只是半个人, 但至少我有勇气面前敌人.
Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.

306
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,375
石鸦部落的人呢?
What do the Stone Crows do?

307
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,644
还不是只敢躲在石头后面发抖
Hide behind rocks and shiver

308
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,647
当谷地的骑士经过的时候?
when the knights of the Vale ride by?

309
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:43,317
你们就只偷得到这种货色?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?

310
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:46,554
杀羊或许可以,
Good enough for killing sheep,

311
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:48,322
还得那羊乖乖认命让你们杀.
if the sheep don't fight back.

312
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:50,557
兰尼斯特家的铁匠拉出的屎都比这高级.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

313
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,633
你以为你能用你的小零碎换你的命?
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?

314
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:13,914
这小零碎比你们部落的所有东西都更值钱.
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.

315
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:19,189
如果你肯帮我们, 多夫之子夏嘎,
But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,

316
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:21,892
我不止会给你小零碎.
I will not give you trinkets.

317
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,394
我会给你这个.
I will give you this.

318
00:22:25,297 --> 00:22:26,897
什么 "这个"?
What is "this"?

319
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:30,601
整个艾林谷.
The Vale of Arryn.

320
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:33,938
艾林谷的领主们一直在欺压山地部落.
The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.

321
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:38,175
艾林谷的领主们想要我死.
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.

322
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:42,980
我想是时候让谷地换一批新领主了.
I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.

323
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:52,721
<i>真是难得一见的人物...
Ser Alliser: Now there's a rare sight--</i>

324
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:56,259
不但是个野种, 还是个叛国者的野种呢.
not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.

325
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:10,006
- 琼恩, 不要! - 琼恩, 住手, 把刀放下!
- Jon, no! - Jon, stop, put it down!

326
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:15,344
血统决定善恶.
Blood will always tell.

327
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:18,515
你会被吊死的, 野种.
You'll hang for this, bastard.

328
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,035
我告诉过你别做傻事.
I told you not to do anything stupid.

329
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:44,704
你被关禁闭了. 去吧.
You're confined to quarters. Go.

白灵, 怎么了?
Ghost, what's wrong?

332

(奴隶贩子会送给我们金钱.)

356

我以为多斯拉克人不信赖金钱.
Daenerys: I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.

358
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:58,405

- 卡丽熙? - 你听到我的命令了.
- Khaleesi? - You heard me.

363

These men have shed blood for their Khal. Now they claim their rewards.

欢迎你这么做, 安伯大人.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.

455
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,339
等我收拾完兰尼斯特家
And when I am done with the Lannisters

456
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:15,674
我会立刻回师北上,
I will march back North,

457
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,176
把你从你的城堡里抓出来
root you out of your Keep

458
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:19,881
并当成背誓者吊死.
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

459
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,915
背誓者, 是吗?!
Oathbreaker, is it?!

460
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:26,054
我可不会干坐着任人侮辱
I'll not sit here and swallow insults

461
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,623
特别是象你这种刚从泥里钻出来的小鬼, 八成连尿都还有青草气.
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

462
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:31,459
( Snarls )

463
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:34,194
<i>( Screaming )</i>

464
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:45,105
我父亲曾教导我必须以死刑惩戒...
My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel

465
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:47,207
<i>敢对主君拔剑的封臣.
- against your Liege Lord. - ( Huffs )</i>

466
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,545
但我相信大琼恩只是想帮我切肉罢了.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.

467
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:56,017
你的肉...
Your meat...

468
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:03,826
还真他妈的硬.
is bloody tough.

469
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:06,895
<i>( Chortles )</i>

470
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,967
( All laughing )

471
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,429
- 怎么了? 出什么事了? - 嘘, 没什么.
- What is it? What's happened? - Shh, it's all right.

472
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:45,471
- 你要去哪儿? - 去南方. 去救父亲.
- Where are you going? - South. For father.

473
00:34:45,505 --> 00:34:47,206
可现在是午夜啊.
But it's the middle of the night.

474
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,375
兰尼斯特家的探子无处不在.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

475
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,976
我不希望让他们知道我们已经出发.
I don't want them to know we're coming.

476
00:34:52,012 --> 00:34:54,713
他们的人马比我们多.
They have more men than we do.

477
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:56,949
嗯, 是这样的.
Aye, they do.

478
00:34:56,983 --> 00:34:59,050
我能和你一起去吗?
Can't I come with you?

479
00:34:59,085 --> 00:35:01,586
现在我能骑马了. 你看过我骑马了.
I can ride now. You've seen me riding.

480
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,722
我不会再惹麻烦的, 我...
And I won't get in the way, I--

481
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:06,291
临冬城必须有史塔克家的人坐镇.
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.

482
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:08,460
在我回来之前你就是城主.
Until I return that will be you.

483
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:14,199
我们走后你绝不能离开城堡. 明白吗?
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone. Do you understand?

484
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:20,206
好好听从鲁温师傅的教导. 好好照顾你的弟弟.
Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.

485
00:35:20,242 --> 00:35:22,376
我会的.
I will.

486
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,478
我有时间就会写信回来,
I'll send letters whenever I can,

487
00:35:24,512 --> 00:35:26,748
但如果你很久没收到我的信,
but if you don't hear from me,

488
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:28,684
也不要担心.
don't be scared.

489
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:35,992
我会回来的.
Until I return.

490
00:35:56,215 --> 00:35:59,282
你躲在那儿多久了?
How long have you been hiding out there?

491
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:02,786
罗柏会找你道别.
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.

492
00:36:04,123 --> 00:36:06,056
他们全都走了.
They've all gone away.

493
00:36:06,092 --> 00:36:09,027
他们很快就会回来. 罗柏会救出父亲
They'll be back soon. Robb will free father

494
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,262
他们会和母亲一道回来.
and they'll come back with mother.

495
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:15,434
不, 他们不会.
No, they won't.

496
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:22,208
<i>请你们务必看顾罗柏.
Bran: Please watch over Robb.</i>

497
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:24,710
也请你们看顾临冬城所所有人马.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.

498
00:36:24,744 --> 00:36:27,913
还有, 还有席恩.
And Theon too, I suppose.

499
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:36,387
你听见了吗, 孩子?
You hear them, boy?

500
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:39,023
旧神正在回答你.
The Old Gods are answering you.

501
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:40,958
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

502
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:43,862
他们也是我的神.
They're my Gods too.

503
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:48,967
在长城之外, 他们是惟一的真神.
Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.

504
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:52,639
即便奴隶也可以祈祷.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.

505
00:36:52,672 --> 00:36:55,041
你可不是奴隶.
You're not a slave.

506
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,079
嗯, 你的朋友确实曾经拿刀抵住我的喉咙.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.

507
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:03,817
我不是在抱怨, 小领主,
I'm not complaining, Little Lord,

508
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:06,585
只是说出事实.
just telling truths.

509
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:10,690
你说听见神说话是什么意思?
What did you mean about hearing the Gods?

510
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:13,059
你向他们祈求,
You asked them,

511
00:37:13,092 --> 00:37:14,726
而他们正在回答.
they're answering you.

512
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:17,731
嘘.
Shh.

513
00:37:17,764 --> 00:37:19,431
竖起耳朵.
Open your ears.

514
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:21,867
<i>( Leaves rustling )</i>

515
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:27,106
不过是风声.
It's only the wind.

516
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:30,143
你以为这风是谁送来的?
Who do you think sends the wind

517
00:37:30,177 --> 00:37:32,144
如果不是诸神的话?
if not the Gods?

518
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:33,880
他们能看到你, 孩子.
They see you, boy.

519
00:37:33,914 --> 00:37:36,317
<i>他们也能听到你说话.
They hear you.</i>

520
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:37,918
<i>( Sighs )</i>

521
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:40,789
在你哥哥要去的地方, 他们无法帮他.
Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.

522
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:43,625
旧神在南方没有力量.
The Old Gods have no power in the South.

523
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:47,329
那儿的鱼梁木早已被砍伐一空.
The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.

524
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:50,132
没有眼睛, 他们如何看顾你哥哥呢?
How can they watch when they have no eyes?

525
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,567
<i>( Running footsteps )</i>

526
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,039
嗯, 真是个大块头.
( Osha giggles ) Well, there's a big man.

527
00:37:57,072 --> 00:38:00,242
我敢说他有巨人的血统.
He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.

528
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:02,643
回去找你的衣服, 阿多.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.

529
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:04,512
<i>去穿衣服吧.
- ( Laughs ) - Go dress.</i>

530
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:06,079
阿多.
Hodor.

531
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:11,418
长城之外真的有巨人吗?
Are there really giants beyond the Wall?

532
00:38:12,788 --> 00:38:15,757
有巨人, 还有比巨人更可怕的生物.
Giants and worse than giants.

533
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,760
我跟你哥哥说过,
I tried telling your brother,

534
00:38:18,793 --> 00:38:20,594
他走错方向了.
he's marching the wrong way.

535
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:24,132
所有的人马, 他们应该去北方, 孩子.
All these swords, they should be going North, boy.

536
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,333
北方, 不是南方!
North, not south!

537
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:31,472
寒风已然吹起.
The cold winds are rising.

538
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,007
<i>( Leaves rustling )</i>

539
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,793
他们被异鬼做了手脚.
They were touched by White Walkers.

540
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,297
所以他们才会回来.
That's why they came back.

541
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,199
所以他们的眼睛才会变成蓝色.
That's why their eyes turned blue.

542
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:59,369
只有火能阻止他们.
Only fire will stop them.

543
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,072
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

544
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,842
我从书上看到的...
I read about it in a book--

545
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,945
伊蒙师傅的图书馆里的一本非常古老的书.
a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.

546
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,615
那本书还说了些什么?
What else did the book say?

547
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,550
异鬼
The White Walkers

548
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,353
在冰层之下沉睡了数千年.
sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.

549
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:19,923
当他们苏醒的时候...
And when they wake up--

550
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:24,762
当他们苏醒的时候会怎样?
And when they wake up, what?

551
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:30,233
我希望长城足够高.
I hope The Wall is high enough.

552
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,257
( Men chattering )

553
00:40:02,764 --> 00:40:05,065
是夏雪, 夫人.
Summer snows, My Lady.

554
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:08,135
罗柏马带来了北境的人马.
Robb's brought the North with him.

555
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:16,210
河间地的领主们正在败退
The River Lords are falling back

556
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,079
詹姆兰尼斯特在后面穷追不舍.
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

557
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:21,516
而泰温大人正带着另一支兰尼斯特军队从南方进逼.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.

558
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,320
我们的斥候报告说其规模比弑君者的更庞大.
Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.

559
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,625
管他一支还是两支军队, 北境之王...
One army or two, the Kings in the North

560
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,461
能够打垮十倍优势的敌人.
threw back hosts 10 times as large.

561
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,632
母亲!
Mother!

562
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,271
你气色很好.
You look well.

563
00:40:43,773 --> 00:40:47,543
凯特琳夫人, 在此动乱时刻见到您真是高兴.
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.

564
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:50,045
我们没想到会在这里见到您, 夫人.
We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.

565
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:53,583
我也没想到会来这里.
I had not thought to be here.

566
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,684
我想单独和我儿子讲几句话.
I would speak with my son alone.

567
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,021
相信诸位大人能够理解.
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.

568
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,289
你们听见夫人说的话了! 快动身!
You heard her! Move your asses!

569
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,659
快点, 到外面去.
Come on, out.

570
00:41:02,695 --> 00:41:05,329
你也是, 葛雷乔伊. 你他妈的耳聋了吗?
You too, Greyjoy. Are you bloody deaf?

571
00:41:05,364 --> 00:41:07,266
不要担心, 夫人.
Have no fear, My Lady.

572
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,068
<i>我们会拿剑拥穿泰温兰尼斯特的屁眼...
We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole</i>

573
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,871
然后打下红堡救出奈德.
and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.

574
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:15,838
- 你这老鬼头, 罗德利克. - 大琼恩.
- You old devil, Rodrik. - Jon.

575
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,208
你的功夫还没荒废, 是吗?
You're not wasting away, are you?

576
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:32,288
我还清楚地记得你出生那天的样子...
I remember the day you came into this world

577
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:35,358
脸红红的, 大声哭闹.
red-faced and squalling.

578
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,528
现在我却看到你率领着一支大军上战场.
And now I find you leading a host to war.

579
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:42,965
- 没别人了. - 没别人?
- There was no one else. - No one?

580
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,735
我刚才见到的那些人是谁?
Who were those men I saw here?

581
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,838
- 他们都不是史塔克. - 他们都身经百战.
- None of them are Starks. - All of them are seasoned in battle.

582
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,909
如果你想把我送回临冬城...
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell--

583
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,210
哦, 我真希望能这么做.
Oh, would that I could.

584
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,250
我收到了...
There was...

585
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,719
一封信.
a letter.

586
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,590
珊莎写来的.
From Sansa.

587
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,860
你的意思是王后写来的.
From the Queen, you mean.

588
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:19,936
- 上面没有提到艾莉亚. - 确实没有.
- There's no mention of Arya. - No.

589
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,880
你带来多少人?
How many men do you have?

590
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:35,317
一万八千.
18,000.

591
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:37,818
如果我去君临向乔佛里屈膝下跪...
If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey--

592
00:42:37,853 --> 00:42:40,922
不, 那样你将永远无法离开.
you would never be allowed to leave. No.

593
00:42:40,956 --> 00:42:43,724
我们最大的希望... 或者说惟一的希望...
Our best hope-- our only hope--

594
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:47,061
便是你能在战场上击败对手.
is that you can defeat them in the field.

595
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:49,130
如果我战败?
And if I lose?

596
00:42:49,164 --> 00:42:51,699
你知道坦格利安家孩子们的下场吗...
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children

597
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:54,737
- 当君临城陷的时候? - 他们在睡梦中被屠杀.
- when the Mad King fell? - They were butchered in their sleep.

598
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:57,472
是泰温兰尼斯特下的命令.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

599
00:42:57,507 --> 00:43:00,210
多年的时光并没有使他变仁慈一点.
And the years have not made him kinder.

600
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:05,483
如果你战败,
If you lose,

601
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:08,219
你的父亲会死,
your father dies,

602
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,786
你的妹妹们也会死,
your sisters die,

603
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,054
<i>我们都会死.
we die.</i>

604
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,659
好吧, 那事情就简单了.
Well, that makes it simple then.

605
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:19,994
我想是这样.
I suppose it does.

606
00:43:43,016 --> 00:43:46,251
现在最好由波隆和我两个过去.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.

607
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:48,856
对泰温之子提利昂来说最好.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.

608
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:50,891
对我们来说可不好.
Not best for me.

609
00:43:50,925 --> 00:43:54,094
如果半人背叛我们,
If the half man betrays us,

610
00:43:54,128 --> 00:43:57,565
多夫之子夏嘎就会剁掉他的命根子...
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood--

611
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,135
拿去喂山羊, 我知道.
and feed it to the goats, yes.

612
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:05,206
那好吧.
All right then.

613
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,443
我要去见我父亲了.
Time to meet my father.

614
00:44:39,775 --> 00:44:42,577
- 提利昂. - 叔叔.
- Tyrion. - Uncle.

615
00:44:42,612 --> 00:44:44,480
父亲.
Father.

616
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,983
看来关于你已死的传言不攻自破了.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.

617
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:52,420
真抱歉让您失望了.
Sorry to disappoint you.

618
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:54,989
这些是什么人...
And who are these...

619
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:57,257
<i>你的同伴?
Companions of yours?</i>

620
00:44:59,327 --> 00:45:01,760
这位是多夫之子夏嘎,
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,

621
00:45:01,795 --> 00:45:04,164
<i>石鸦部的酋长.
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.</i>

622
00:45:04,197 --> 00:45:08,568
<i>提魅之子提魅, 灼人部的首领.
Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.</i>

623
00:45:08,601 --> 00:45:13,340
<i>这位美少女是齐克之女齐拉
This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk,</i>

624
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:15,742
<i>黑耳部的领袖.
leader of the Black Ears.</i>

625
00:45:15,777 --> 00:45:19,146
而这位是波隆, 谁人之子来着...
And here we have Bronn son of...

626
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:21,782
你不会认识他的.
You wouldn't know him.

627
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:26,355
可否允许我为各位介绍我的父亲大人,
May I present My Lord Father,

628
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:29,023
兰尼斯特家族的泰陀斯之子泰温,
Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,

629
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,126
<i>凯岩城主暨西境守护.
Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?</i>

630
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:36,733
非常感谢您为我出兵打仗.
Kind of you to go to war for me.

631
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:41,704
你使我们别无选择.
You left us no choice.

632
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,806
这事关家族的荣誉.
The honor of the House was at stake.

633
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,478
你哥哥詹姆绝不会如此轻易地束手就擒的.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.

634
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,047
我们确实有所不同, 詹姆和我.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.

635
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,250
他更勇敢. 而我更帅气.
He's braver. I'm better looking.

636
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:55,619
他满身都是荣耀.
He's been covering himself in glory.

637
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:58,889
詹姆在金牙城外击溃了三河诸侯,
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth,

638
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:02,592
现在正在围攻奔流城, 凯特琳史塔克的老家.
and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.

639
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,728
史塔克家在做什么? 艾德大人?
And the Starks? Lord Eddard?

640
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,831
--现在是我们的人质. 他在地牢里无法带兵打仗.
--Is our hostage. He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.

641
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,900
我那美丽的姐姐是怎么说服国王
How did my sweet sister persuade the King

642
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,802
囚禁他亲爱的朋友奈德的?
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

643
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:16,807
劳勃拜拉席恩死了. 如今是乔佛里在君临执政.
Robert Baratheon is dead. Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

644
00:46:19,813 --> 00:46:21,780
你的意思是说是我姐姐在执政.
My sister rules, you mean.

645
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:25,284
史塔克的儿子已经下令召集封臣.
Stark's son has called his banners.

646
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:28,755
- 他正带着一支大军南下. - 不过是个毛头小子.
- He moves south with a strong host. - A green boy.

647
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,556
等他尝到战斗的滋味就会...
One taste of battle and he'll run

648
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,159
夹着尾巴逃回临冬城.
back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.

649
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:35,862
也许吧.
Maybe.

650
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:38,465
不过那小子确实很好战.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.

651
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:41,001
你会喜欢他的.
You'd like him.

652
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:45,072
既然我们说到打仗的事情,
While we're on the subject of war,

653
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:47,807
我对这几位朋友做过承诺
I made promises to my friends here

654
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:50,210
而兰尼斯特有债必还.
and a Lannister always pays his debts.

655
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:53,313
<i>我们需要三千个头盔和盾牌,
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields,</i>

656
00:46:53,347 --> 00:46:55,581
还有刀剑, 长枪,
plus swords, pikes,

657
00:46:55,615 --> 00:46:57,416
护甲, 钉锤...
gorgets, maces--

658
00:46:57,451 --> 00:47:00,018
如果大人同意,
if it please My Lord,

659
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:02,121
亚当爵士要我来报告, 北境军队
Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen

660
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:03,554
已经越过了颈泽.
have crossed the neck.

661
00:47:05,557 --> 00:47:08,025
小狼就要钻进狮口了.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.

662
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:12,297
好吧. 凯冯, 立刻下令敲鼓集合.
So be it. Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.

663
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,936
并送信给詹姆说我将前去同罗柏史塔克决战.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.

664
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:18,938
遵命, 大人.
At once, My Lord.

665
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:34,855
听说山地部落的人都是伟大的战士.
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.

666
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:36,623
与我一同出兵作战
Ride with me against my enemies

667
00:47:36,657 --> 00:47:39,693
你们将得到我儿子承诺的一切, 甚至更多.
and you shall have all my son promised you and more.

668
00:47:39,728 --> 00:47:41,963
但这个半人得跟我们一起作战.
Only if the half man fights with us.

669
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:45,434
直到我们拿到他答应的武器,
Until we hold the steel he pledged us,

670
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:47,869
这小狮子的命是我们的.
the little lion's life is ours.

671
00:47:53,443 --> 00:47:56,112
<i>斥候报告说泰温大人正在北上.
Rodrik: The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.</i>

672
00:47:56,146 --> 00:47:57,980
我们需要凭借险要地形截住他,
We need to get him on broken ground,

673
00:47:58,014 --> 00:47:59,681
使他的骑士无法发挥力量.
put his Knights at a disadvantage.

674
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:01,818
不, 我们要从他侧面绕过去
No, we need to get around him

675
00:48:01,851 --> 00:48:04,753
并打破詹姆兰尼斯特对奔流城的围攻.
and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

676
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:07,623
这样三河诸候就会加入我们的队伍.
Do that and the River Lords will join us.

677
00:48:07,657 --> 00:48:09,525
无论怎样做我们都需要先过绿叉河
To do either we need to cross the river

678
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,226
而孪河城是过河的惟一路线.
and the only crossing is at The Twins.

679
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,295
<i>佛雷大人控制着孪河桥.
Theon: Lord Frey controls that bridge.</i>

680
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:14,896
他是你父亲的封臣.
Your father's bannerman.

681
00:48:14,931 --> 00:48:18,166
我父亲称他为 "迟到的佛雷大人"
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.

682
00:48:18,201 --> 00:48:21,704
当年三叉戟河之战, 他在战斗结束后才现身.
At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.

683
00:48:21,737 --> 00:48:25,775
不是每个人都把自己的誓言当回事的.
Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.

684
00:48:27,744 --> 00:48:30,278
( Grunting )

685
00:48:33,182 --> 00:48:35,918
罗柏说得对. 我们需要那座桥.
Robb's right. We need that bridge.

686
00:48:35,952 --> 00:48:38,052
那么该怎么办?
So what's it going to be?

687
00:48:38,088 --> 00:48:41,489
我们先对付詹姆还是泰温?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?

688
00:48:45,661 --> 00:48:47,195
打扰了, 大人.
Your pardon, my lords.

689
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,898
<i>我们抓住了一个兰尼斯特军的斥候.
We've captured a Lannister scout.</i>

690
00:48:51,802 --> 00:48:55,137
别担心, 小伙子. 他不会活着离开这个帐篷.
Don't worry, lad. He won't b  leaving this tent with his head.

691
00:48:56,474 --> 00:48:58,141
你们在哪儿发现他的?
Where did you find him?

692
00:48:58,175 --> 00:49:00,309
在营地周围的树丛里.
In the brush above the encampment.

693
00:49:00,344 --> 00:49:02,211
<i>他好象正在估算人数.
He looked to be counting.</i>

694
00:49:12,657 --> 00:49:14,458
你算出来有多少人?
How high did you get?

695
00:49:16,827 --> 00:49:18,829
两万. 或许更多.
20,000. Maybe more.

696
00:49:19,864 --> 00:49:21,597
你不必自己动手行刑.
You don't have to do this yourself.

697
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:23,199
您父亲会理解的...
Your father would understand--

698
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:27,269
我父亲懂得仁慈, 如果不是非杀不可.
My father unrstands mercy, when there is room for it.

699
00:49:28,672 --> 00:49:30,505
他也懂得荣誉...
And he understands honor...

700
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:35,577
和勇气.
and courage.

701
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:39,315
放他走吧.
Let him go.

702
00:49:40,284 --> 00:49:42,684
罗柏.
Robb.

703
00:49:54,697 --> 00:49:57,664
去告诉泰温大人, 凛冬将至.
( Softly ) Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.

704
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:02,635
两万北境大军正在南下, 看看他是不是真的能拉金屎.
20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.

705
00:50:04,706 --> 00:50:06,206
遵命, 大人.
Yes, My Lord.

706
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,041
多谢, 大人.
Thank you, My Lord.

707
00:50:17,485 --> 00:50:21,188
你疯了吗, 孩子?! 放他走?
Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?

708
00:50:21,222 --> 00:50:23,257
你又称我孩子了.
You call me boy again.

709
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,393
下去吧.
Go on.

710
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,802
( Growls )

711
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:46,612
喂.
Oi.

712
00:50:51,684 --> 00:50:54,353
<i>国王陛下决定...
Pycelle: It is also the wish of His Grace</i>

713
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:59,693
<i>尽忠职守的杰诺斯史林特,

00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:02,829
<i>- 都城守卫队司令... - 艾伦爵士.

715
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:06,434
<i>立刻擢升为贵族...
...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...</i>

716
00:51:06,467 --> 00:51:11,938
<i>- 盖尔斯大人. - ...赐予古老的赫伦堡,
- Lord Gyles. - ...And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal,</i>

717
00:51:11,972 --> 00:51:15,809
<i>其子嗣将世代继承此等荣耀
and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor</i>

718
00:51:15,842 --> 00:51:20,947
<i>直到世界末日.
after him until the end of time.</i>

719
00:51:20,981 --> 00:51:23,481
( Lords mutter )

720
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:28,119
为取代叛徒艾德史塔克,
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,

721
00:51:28,153 --> 00:51:32,824
<i>国王陛下决定由泰温兰尼斯特,
it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister,</i>

722
00:51:32,858 --> 00:51:36,661
<i>凯岩城主暨西境守护,

723
00:51:36,695 --> 00:51:40,798
<i>担任国王之手.
be appointed Hand of the King.</i>

724
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,733
最后,
Lastly,

725
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:45,603
于此密谋四起, 动乱不堪之际,
in these times of treason and turmoil,

00:51:45,637 --> 00:51:48,873
<i>御前会议认为...
it is the view of the Council</i>

乔佛里国王的生命安全
that the life and safety

728
00:51:51,476 --> 00:51:54,144
of King Joffrey

729
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:58,416
实乃第一要务.
be of paramount importance.

730
00:52:00,018 --> 00:52:02,552
巴利斯坦赛尔弥爵士.
Ser Barristan Selmy.

731
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:12,396
陛下, 我听候您的差遣.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.

732
00:52:12,431 --> 00:52:14,532
请起, 巴利斯坦爵士.
Rise, Ser Barristan.

733
00:52:15,402 --> 00:52:17,503
你可以卸下头盔了.
You may remove your helm.

734
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:25,045
<i>长久以来你为国效命，尽忠职守.
You have served the Realm long and faithfully.</i>

735
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:29,050
<i>七国上下每个人都对你心怀感激.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.</i>

736
00:52:29,085 --> 00:52:32,353
然而是时候让你卸下你的铠甲和宝剑了.
But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.

737
00:52:32,387 --> 00:52:35,289
<i>你该安享晚年, 并自豪地回顾...
It is time to rest and look back with pride</i>

738
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:36,958
你长久以来的功绩了.

陛下, 御林铁卫乃是宣誓效命的兄弟.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.

741
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,797
<i>我们必须终身守誓.
Our vows are taken for life.</i>

742
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:46,335
惟有一死才能解除我们的神圣使命.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

743
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:50,072
是谁的死, 巴利斯坦爵士? 是你还是你的国王?
Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?

744
00:52:50,106 --> 00:52:52,974
<i>我父亲的死就是你的责任.
Joffrey: You let my father die.</i>

745
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:55,945
你太老了, 谁都保护不了.
You're too old to protect anybody.

746
00:52:58,248 --> 00:53:00,983
- 陛下-- - 御前会议已经决定
- Your Grace-- - The Council has determined

747
00:53:01,018 --> 00:53:03,452
由詹姆兰尼斯特爵士接替你的职务
that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place

748
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:05,755
<i>担任御林铁卫队长.
as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.</i>

749
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:07,324
那个人玷污了自己的宝剑
The man who profaned his blade

750
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:09,559
杀死了他宣誓要保护的国王!
with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!

751
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:11,527
小心一点, 爵士.
Careful, Ser.

752
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:13,262
我们并非不知感恩
We have nothing but gratitude

753
00:53:13,297 --> 00:53:15,766
您的长期贡献有目共睹, 爵士.
for your long service, good Ser.

754
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,268
您将得到一座坚固的海滨城堡,
You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea,

755
00:53:18,302 --> 00:53:20,637
以及满足您需要的大批仆役.
with servants to look after your every need.

756
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,871
给我一个养老的地方
A hall to die in

757
00:53:22,907 --> 00:53:25,307
<i>以及为我送终的人.
and men to bury me.</i>

758
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:29,945
我既生为一名骑士.
I am a Knight.

759
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:33,016
也要死得像个骑士.
I shall die a Knight.

760
00:53:38,956 --> 00:53:41,090
像个没穿衣服的骑士, 是吧.
A naked Knight, apparently.

761
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:43,260
( Laughter )

762
00:53:52,235 --> 00:53:55,672
即便现在我仍可以像切蛋糕一样把你们五个通通砍倒!
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!

763
00:53:59,844 --> 00:54:02,378
拿去, 小子!
Here, boy!

764
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:04,847
把它熔了加到铁王座上吧.
Melt it down and add it to the others.

765
00:54:19,362 --> 00:54:21,329
<i>( Doors creak, clang )</i>

766
00:54:21,364 --> 00:54:23,699
如果在场各位还有其他事...
If any man in this hall has other matters

767
00:54:23,733 --> 00:54:26,867
请现在向国王陛下禀报
to set before His Grace, let him speak now

768
00:54:26,902 --> 00:54:30,139
否则退朝.
or go forth and hold his silence.

769
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:34,945
陛下.
Your Grace.

770
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:37,347
请上前来, 小姐.
Come forward, My Lady.

771
00:54:39,117 --> 00:54:41,853
<i>史塔克家族的珊莎小姐.
Steward: The Lady Sansa of House Stark.</i>

772
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:46,791
珊莎, 你有事禀报国王陛下和御前会议?
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?

773
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:48,659
是的.
I do.

774
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:56,634
启禀陛下, 我要为我父亲请求您的慈悲,
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,

775
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,137
艾德史塔克大人, 前任国王之手.
Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.

776
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:03,039
叛国大罪好似带毒的野草.
Treason is a noxious weed.

777
00:55:03,074 --> 00:55:07,244
- 必须连根拔除... - 让她说下去.
- It should be torn out, root-- - Let her speak.

778
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,981
我要听听她的话.
I want to hear what she says.

779
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:12,150
感谢您, 陛下.
Thank you, Your Grace.

780
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,788
你要否认你父亲所犯罪行?
Do you deny your father's crime?

781
00:55:14,822 --> 00:55:19,293
不, 诸位大人. 我明白他必须接受惩罚.
No, My Lords. I know he must be punished.

782
00:55:19,327 --> 00:55:21,327
我请求的只是慈悲为怀.
All I ask is mercy.

783
00:55:21,362 --> 00:55:24,231
<i>我知道我父亲必定对其所为懊悔不已.
I know My Lord father must regret what he did.</i>

784
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:26,568
他是劳勃国王的好友, 他敬爱国王.
He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.

785
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:28,802
你们知道他是真心敬爱他.
You all know he loved him.

786
00:55:28,838 --> 00:55:32,440
他从未想当国王之手, 直到国王要求他.
He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.

787
00:55:32,474 --> 00:55:35,876
他必定是受人蛊惑... 蓝礼大人或史坦尼斯大人
They must have lied to him-- Lord Renly or Lord Stannis

788
00:55:35,909 --> 00:55:38,711
或是其他什么人. 他们欺骗了他!
or somebody. They must have lied!

789
00:55:38,746 --> 00:55:41,215
他说我不是国王.
He said I wasn't the King.

790
00:55:41,248 --> 00:55:43,315
他为什么要那样说?
Why did he say that?

791
00:55:43,351 --> 00:55:45,619
他受了重伤.
He was badly hurt.

792
00:55:45,652 --> 00:55:48,521
派席尔大学士给他服用了罂粟花奶.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.

793
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:52,724
当时他神智不清. 否则他绝不会那样说的.
He wasn't himself. Otherwise h  never would have said it.

794
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:58,931
孩子对父亲的信赖... 多么单纯天真.
A child's faith... Such sweet innocence.

795
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:02,635
<i>可是人们不是常说, 智慧之言往往来自
And yet they say wisdom oft comes</i>

796
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,503
孩童之口么.
from the mouths of babes.

797
00:56:04,538 --> 00:56:08,675
但叛国就是叛国!
Treason is treason!

798
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:13,980
你还有什么事?
Anything else?

799
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,952
如果您心里仍然有我,
If you still have any affection in your heart for me,

800
00:56:18,985 --> 00:56:22,487
请成全我这个心愿吧, 陛下.
please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

801
00:56:32,065 --> 00:56:34,331
你的肺腑之言感动了我.
Your sweet words have moved me.

802
00:56:36,735 --> 00:56:39,302
但你父亲必须先俯首认罪.
But your father has to confess.

803
00:56:39,338 --> 00:56:42,940
他必须承认我是他的国王...
He has to confess and say that I'm the King...

804
00:56:45,842 --> 00:56:47,978
不然我无法手下留情.
Or there'll be no mercy for him.

805
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:54,550
他一定会的.
He will.

806
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:04,561

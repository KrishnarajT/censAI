Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,100
You'll be coming with me, boy,
and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

lt told me to come with him, so l did.

14

We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

[Osha] Your father's not down there, little lord.

That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.

27
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,764

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,582
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

180
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,543
The King in the North!

181
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,630
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

182
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,341
The King in the North!

183
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,264
- Lady Stark.
- l want to see him.

184
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,975
Now!

185
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,773
[Prisoners coughing]

186
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,373
Leave us.

187
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,715
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.

188
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,549
Widowhood becomes you.

189
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,346
Your bed must be lonely.

190
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,264
ls that why you came?

191
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,061
l'm not at my best,
but l think l could be of service.

192
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,940
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if l'm up to it.

193
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,610
[Groans]

194
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,364
Oh, l do like a violent woman.

195
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,368
l will kill you tonight, ser...

196
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,205
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

197
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,748
Let me show you how...

198
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,250
Hit me again, over the ear.

199
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:45,379
And again and again. You're stronger
than you look. It shouldn't take long.

200
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,134
That is what you want the world to believe,
isn't it? That you don't fear death.

201
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,427
But l don't, my lady.

202
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,764
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

203
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,434
Because you are going
to the deepest of the seven hells,

204
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,730
- if the gods are just.
- What gods are those?

205
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,901
The trees your husband prayed to?

206
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,195
Where were the trees
when his head was getting chopped off?

207
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:13,075
lf your gods are real and if they are just...

208
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,326
why is the world so full of injustice?

209
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,580
Because of men like you.

210
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,125
There are no men like me.

211
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,253
Only me.

212
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,760
My son Bran.

213
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,306
How did he come to fall from that tower?

214
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,932
l pushed him out the window.

215
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:42,895
Why?

216
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,442
l...hoped the fall would kill him.

217
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,943
Why?

218
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,288
You should get some sleep.

219
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,623
lt's going to be a long war.

220
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,983
l can't believe we're actually at war.

221
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,322
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

222
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,161
What does it say?

223
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,788
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

224
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,166
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

225
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,377
Get back into bed.

226
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,346
They have my son.

227
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,269
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

228
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,647
l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men
and as many horses.

229
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,357
ls it true about Stannis and Renly?

230
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,152
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

231
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,738
Jaime captured, his armies scattered...

232
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,656
lt's a catastrophe.

233
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,660
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

234
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:21,827
[Goblet shatters]

235
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,832
There's your peace.

236
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,627
Joffrey saw to that when he decided
to remove Ned Stark's head.

237
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,839
You'll have an easier time
drinking from that cup

238
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,968
than you will bringing Robb Stark
to the table now.

239
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,510
He's winning...

240
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:41,807
- in case you hadn't noticed.
- l'm told we still have his sisters.

241
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,268
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

242
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,604
No truces. We can't afford to look weak.
We should march on them at once.

243
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,940
First we must return to Casterly Rock
to raise...

244
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,483
They have my son!

245
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,197
Get out, all of you.

246
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,876
Not you.

247
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,603
You were right about Eddard Stark.

248
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:35,693
lf he were alive, we could have used him to
broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,

249
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:41,282
which would have given us more time
to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...

250
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,286
Madness. Madness and stupidity.

251
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,291
l always thought you were a stunted fool.

252
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,128
Perhaps l was wrong.

253
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,923
Half wrong.

254
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,926
l'm new to strategy, but...

255
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:04,013
Unless we want to be surrounded
by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.

256
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,807
No one will stay here.

257
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:09,560
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders

258
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,731
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

259
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,859
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.

260
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,240
And you will go to King's Landing.

261
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,701
- And do what?
- Rule.

262
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:29,038
You will serve as Hand of the King
in my stead.

263
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,334
You will bring that boy king to heel,
and his mother too, if needs be.

264
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:36,087
And if you get so much as a whim of treason
from any of the rest -

265
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,215
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...
- Heads, spikes, walls.

266
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,677
Why not my uncle?

267
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,012
Why not anyone? Why me?

268
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,473
You're my son.

269
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,233
Oh, one more thing.

270
00:21:57,276 --> 00:22:00,612
You will not take that whore to court.

271
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,405
Do you understand?

272
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,746
[Animals calling]

273
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,719
Ser Jorah?

274
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,893
Gently, gently.

275
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,395
My son...

276
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,856
Where is he? l want him.

277
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,278
Where is he?

278
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,574
The boy did not live.

279
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:55,459
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

280
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:57,836
How did my son die?

281
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:02,423
He never lived, my princess.

282
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,009
The women say...

283
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,260
What do the women say?

284
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,852
- They say the child was...
- [Mirri] Monstrous, twisted.

285
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,854
l pulled him out myself.

286
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,982
He was scaled like a lizard,

287
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:24,320
blind, with leather wings
like the wings of a bat.

288
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:27,490
When l touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

289
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:31,369
lnside...he was full of graveworms.

290
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:38,335
l warned you that only death
can pay for life.

291
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,336
You knew the price.

292
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,339
Where is Khal Drogo?

293
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,509
Show him to me.

294
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:51,013
Show me what l bought with my son's life.

295
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,099
As you command, lady.

296
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,644
Come. l will take you to him.

297
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,565
- Time enough for that later...
- l want to see him now.

298
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,540
The khalasar is gone.

299
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,376
A khal who cannot ride is no khal.

300
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,130
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

301
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,133
l'm sorry, my Princess.

302
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,354
Drogo!

303
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,773
[Speaks Dothraki] *Shekh ma shieraki anni!*
My sun and stars.

304
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,567
Why is he out here alone?

305
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,528
He seems to like the warmth, Princess.

306
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,576
[Mirri] He lives.

307
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,704
You asked for life, you paid for life.

308
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:00,000
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

309
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,170
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east.

310
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:08,217
When the seas go dry. When the mountains
blow in the wind like leaves.

311
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,067
Leave us.

312
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,778
l don't want you alone with this sorceress.

313
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,074
l have nothing more to fear
from this woman.

314
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,160
Go.

315
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,252
You knew what l was buying
and you knew the price.

316
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,963
lt was wrong of them to burn my temple.

317
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:50,592
- It angered the Great Shepherd.
- This is not God's work.

318
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,679
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

319
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:56,765
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

320
00:25:56,848 --> 00:26:01,060
Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar
will trample no nations into dust.

321
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,605
[Daenerys] l spoke for you.

322
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,775
- l saved you.
- [Chuckles] Saved me?

323
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:13,531
Three of those riders had already
raped me before you saved me, girl.

324
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,996
l saw my god's house burn,

325
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,625
there where l had healed men and women
beyond counting.

326
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,044
ln the streets l saw piles of heads...

327
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,505
the head of the baker who makes my bread,

328
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:32,925
the head of a young boy that l had
cured of fever just three moons past.

329
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:38,222
So... tell me again
exactly what it was that you saved?

330
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,267
Your life.

331
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,813
Why don't you take a look at your khal...

332
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,526
Then you will see exactly
what life is worth...

333
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,320
when all the rest has gone.

334
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,667
You can't!

335
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,546
Get out of my way, Sam.

336
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,548
They'll put out the word.

337
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:15,219
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

338
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,180
Do you know what happens to deserters?

339
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:22,351
Better than you do.

340
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:24,978
What are you going to do?

341
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,021
l'm gonna find my brother

342
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,942
and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

343
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:34,529
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

344
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,407
- Move.
- l won't let you go.

345
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,202
- Move.
- No.

346
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,788
- Hyah!
- [Neighs]

347
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,289
[Grunts]

348
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,597
Hand of the King?

349
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,808
So it would seem.

350
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:08,313
And your father said you couldn't
take anyone with you to King's Landing?

351
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:11,066
No, he said l couldn't take you with me
to King's Landing.

352
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:14,987
- He was very specific on that point.
- He knew my name?

353
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,696
What?

354
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,407
He said,
''Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing''?

355
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,368
l believe he used the word ''whore''.

356
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,538
Are you ashamed of me?

357
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,750
Are you afraid that l'm dancing around
the court with my tits out?

358
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,419
[Chuckles]

359
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:31,711
l'm funny now?

360
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,963
l'm Shae, the funny whore.

361
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,218
My father's probably the most powerful man
in the country.

362
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:39,802
Certainly the richest.

363
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,346
He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.

364
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:47,352
Everyone everywhere always has to do
exactly what my father says.

365
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,771
He's always been a cunt.

366
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:01,157
l believe the ladies of the court
could learn a great deal

367
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,992
from a girl like you.

368
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,333
Why don't you come with me,
be the Hand's lady?

369
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,046
Because the king needs a Hand
and the Hand...

370
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:20,051
l know what a Hand needs.

371
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,730
[Ghost barks]
[Men shouting]

372
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:34,900
Ghost?

373
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,108
[Man] Hyah!

374
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,569
Hyah! Hyah!

375
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,032
Hyah!

376
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,743
[Shrieks]

377
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,371
[Neighs]

378
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,038
Samwell!

379
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,042
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.

380
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,752
[Samwell] Did we get him?

381
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,672
[Grenn] Come on, help me get him up.

382
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:02,176
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

383
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,222
We're taking you back to where you belong.

384
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,892
- l belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

385
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,853
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.

386
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,230
They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.

387
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:16,400
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

388
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,111
- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.

389
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:21,571
You took the oath. You can't leave.

390
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,699
- l have to.
- You can't.

391
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,159
- You said the words.
- l don't care about...

392
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:29,413
''Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow...''

393
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:33,750
- To hell with all of you.
- ''Night gathers and now my watch begins.

394
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:37,003
''lt shall not end until my death.

395
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:39,088
''l shall live and die at my post.''

''l am the sword in the darkness...''

00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,800
''The watcher on the walls...''

398
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,554
[All] ''The shield that guards the realms of men.

399
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:49,307
''l pledge my life and honour

00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:53,103

00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,054

00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:37,064
[Speaks Dothraki] *Hash yer vineseri dothrakh ataki kishi, zhey shekh ma shieraki anni?*
Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars?

You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter.

405
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:56,625
[Speaks Dothraki] *Anha zigerek yeroon lajat ajjin.*
l need you to fight now.

but come back to me, my sun and stars.

408
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,334
[ln English] When the sun...

409
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,920
rises in the west...

410
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:45,423
..and sets in the east...

[Sobs]

00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:52,055
...then you shall return to me,

[Sobbing]

414
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:00,958
Kings? [Chuckles]

415
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:05,796
Oh, l can tell you all there is
to know about kings.

416
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:10,925
The thing you need to understand
about kings is...

417
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:19,684
For the past 6T years, l've known...

418
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:24,648
truly known...
more kings than any man alive.

419
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:30,737
They're complicated men,
but l know how to serve them.

420
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,780
[Chuckles] Yes.

421
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:35,284
And keep on serving them. [Coughs]

422
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,788
Aerys Targaryen.

423
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:46,210
Of all the thousand thousand maladies
the gods visit on us...

424
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,505
madness is the worst.

425
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,550
He was a good man.

426
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,679
Such a charmer.

427
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,391
To watch him melt away before my eyes...

428
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:04,855
consumed by dreams of fire and blood...

429
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,612
Robert Baratheon
was an entirely different animal -

430
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,405
powerful man, great warrior -

431
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:20,494
but alas, winning a kingdom
and ruling a kingdom

432
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:22,873
are rather different things.

433
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,458
They say that...

434
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,045
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

435
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,509
he can often be blind
to the enemies at his side. [Chuckles]

436
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:38,179
[Coughs] Now l serve his son...

437
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,681
King Joffrey...

438
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,351
may the gods bless his reign.

439
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:48,690
He is a capable young man -
strong military mind.

440
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:50,900
Stern.

441
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:55,322
But sternness in defence of the realm
is no vice.

442
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,032
[Coughs]

443
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,327
lt's far too soon to know
what manner of king he will be, but...

444
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:07,458
l sense true greatness on the horizon
for our new king.

445
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,210
Mmm. [Coughs]

446
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,588
True greatness.

447
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,885
So what's the thing?

448
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,347
What thing?

449
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,224
About kings.

450
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:27,144
You said, ''The thing you
need to understand about kings...''

451
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,146
What? Things? What?

452
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,317
When you started, you...
Never mind.

453
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,903
[Mutters] Let me see you out, my dear.

454
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:38,990
- It's all right. No need.
- Yes, yes.

455
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:41,159
Till the next time.

456
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:42,869
[Door closes]

457
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,125
[Sighs]

458
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,222
Right.

459
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:07,186
[Muttering]

460
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:16,570
[Groans]

461
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,878
When you imagine yourself up there,
how do you look?

462
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:35,297
Does the crown fit?

463
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,632
Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow,

464
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,719
the ones who sneered at you for years?

465
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:44,181
lt's hard for them to simper and bow
without heads.

466
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,768
A man with great ambition and no morals -

467
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:50,478
l wouldn't bet against you.

468
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:56,527
And what would you do, my friend,
if you found yourself sitting up there?

469
00:37:56,652 --> 00:38:00,030
l must be one of the few men in this city
who doesn't want to be King.

470
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:03,699
You must be one of the few men in the city
who isn't a man.

471
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,409
Oh, you can do better than that.

472
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:13,376
When they castrated you,
did they take the pillar with the stones?

473
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,295
- l've always wondered.
- Have you?

474
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,590
Do you spend a lot of time
wondering what's between my legs?

475
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:23,804
l picture... a gash. Like a woman's.
Is that about right?

476
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:26,764
l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.

477
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:30,686
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years...

478
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:33,605
a man from another land,

479
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,023
despised by most,

480
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,400
feared by all...

481
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,110
Am l? That is good to know.

482
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:42,572
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

483
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,740
But you carry on...

484
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:48,911
whispering in one king's ear
and then the next.

485
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,958
l admire you.

486
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:56,335
And l admire you, Lord Baelish.

487
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,882
A grasper from a minor House with
a major talent for befriending powerful men...

488
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:04,010
- and women.
- A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.

489
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,347
So...

490
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,474
here we stand...

491
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:13,061
in mutual admiration and respect.

492
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:15,230
Playing our roles.

493
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:16,690
Serving a new king.

494
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:19,108
Long may he reign.

495
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,360
- My king.
- My king.

496
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:25,782
My lords. Shall we begin?

497
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:28,702
[Yoren] You're Arry now, hear me?

498
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,746
Arry the orphan boy.

499
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:35,501
No one asks an orphan too many questions,
cos nobody gives three shits.

500
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,503
What's your name?

501
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:38,795
Arry.

502
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,507
You've a long way to travel,
and in bad company.

503
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,802
l've 20 this time -
men and boys all bound for the Wall.

504
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,181
Your lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons,

505
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,559
and l didn't find no little lordlings
down there.

506
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:54,978
This lot -

507
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:58,940
half of them would turn you over to the king
quick as spit for a pardon.

508
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:03,110
And the other half would do the same,
except they'd rape you first.

509
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,782
So keep to yourself -
and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.

510
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:11,536
You stay with this lot, boy.

511
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:13,163
And stay...

512
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:16,958
or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon
with these three.

513
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,297
Watch yourself, midget.

514
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:26,009
He's got a sword, this one.

515
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:28,679
What's a gutter rat like you
doing with a sword?

516
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:31,764
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

517
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,474
He looks like a girl.

518
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,686
l bet he stole that sword.

519
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:38,146
Let's have a look.

520
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:42,693
l could use me a sword like that.

521
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,152
- Take it off him.
- Give it here, midget.

522
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:48,030
Look at him.
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.

523
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,992
l've seen him kick a boy to death.

524
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:52,286
l knocked him down
and l kicked him in the balls

525
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,663
and l kept kicking him
until he was dead.

526
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:56,581
l kicked him all to pieces.

527
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:01,210
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

528
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:03,005
l'll give it to you.

529
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,757
l already killed one fat boy.

530
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:08,260
l bet you never killed anyone.

531
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,096
l bet you're a liar. But l'm not.

532
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:13,097
l'm good at killing fat boys.

533
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:14,849
l like killing fat boys.

534
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:16,726
[Gasps]

535
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:19,021
You like picking on the little ones, do you?

536
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:21,815
l've been hammering an anvil
these past 10 years.

537
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:24,318
When l hit that steel, it sings.

538
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:27,195
Are you gonna sing when l hit you?

539
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:36,079
This is castle-forged steel.

540
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,289
Where'd you steal it?

541
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:41,083
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

542
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,628
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

543
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:47,090
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen...

544
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:48,634
murderers.

545
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:52,054
- Which are you?
- Armourer's apprentice.

546
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:57,226
But my master got sick of me, so...
here l am.

547
00:41:57,266 --> 00:42:00,436
[Yoren] Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

548
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,856
lt's a thousand leagues from here
to the Wall!

549
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,400
And winter is coming!

550
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,226
Ham.

551
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:44,188
How many days in a row must a man
be expected to start his day with ham?

552
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:47,067
Bring me some beer at least.

553
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:51,112
You look exhausted.

554
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:53,239
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

555
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,786
Don't look so terrified.

556
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:01,539
lf we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

557
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:04,376
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

558
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,838
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

559
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:10,590
Honour made you leave,

560
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:12,384
honour brought you back.

561
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,429
My friends brought me back.

562
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:18,514
l didn't say it was your honour.

563
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:23,269
- They killed my father.
- And you're gonna bring him back to life?

564
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:25,521
No? Good.

565
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,358
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

566
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:34,155
Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are
reporting whole villages abandoned.

567
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,326
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

568
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,577
from dusk until dawn.

569
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:44,123
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

570
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,793
to what ends the gods only know.

571
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,215
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men

572
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:53,550
discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

573
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:57,721
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

574
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:05,478
Do you think your brother's war
is more important than ours?

575
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:07,813
No.

576
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,735
When dead men and worse
come hunting for us in the night,

577
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,739
do you think it matters
who sits on the Iron Throne?

578
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:18,909
- No.
- Good.

579
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:21,661
Because l want you
and your wolf with us

580
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:24,706
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

581
00:44:25,373 --> 00:44:27,416
Beyond the Wall?

582
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:30,545
l'll not sit meekly by...
and wait for the snows.

583
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,590
l mean to find out what's happening.

584
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,635
The Night's Watch will ride in force

585
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:40,931
against the wildlings, the white walkers
and whatever else is out there.

586
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:42,557
[Men shouting]

587
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:46,311
[Mormont] And we will find Benjen Stark,

588
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,980
alive or dead.

589
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:51,148
l will command them myself.

590
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:54,820
So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

591
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,780
[Man] Move out!

592
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,490
[Mormont] ..are you a brother of
the Night's Watch

593
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:03,202
or a bastard boy
who wants to play at war?

594
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,947
ls this your command, Khaleesi?

595
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,498
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs
in the Night Lands.

596
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:54,713
Sell them. You can return to the free cities
and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

597
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,882
They were not given to me to sell.

598
00:46:03,137 --> 00:46:05,474
Khaleesi, my Queen...

599
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:09,061
l vow to serve you, obey you,

600
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:11,063
to die for you if need be...

601
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:14,483
but let him go, Khaleesi.

602
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,777
l know what you intend. Do not.

603
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,570
l must.

604
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,822
[Sighs] You don't understand...

605
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:25,869
Don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

606
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:27,746
l won't watch you burn.

607
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,416
ls that what you fear?

608
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:52,896
You will be my khalasar.

609
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:57,108
l see the faces of slaves.

610
00:46:58,235 --> 00:46:59,610
l free you.

611
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:04,657
Take off your collars.
Go if you wish, no one will stop you.

612
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,284
But if you stay...

613
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:10,914
it will be as brothers and sisters,

614
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:13,291
as husbands and wives.

615
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:21,592
[Chuckles softly]

616
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:27,514
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.

617
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:32,101
You swore to obey me.

618
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,358
[Grunting]

619
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:44,072
l am Daenerys Stormborn...

620
00:47:44,822 --> 00:47:46,992
of House Targaryen...

621
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:48,994
of the blood of old Valyria.

622
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:51,871
l am the Dragon's Daughter.

623
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:54,333
And l swear to you...

624
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:58,170
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

625
00:47:58,295 --> 00:48:00,963
- You will not hear me scream.
- l will.

626
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:05,802
But it is not your screams l want.

627
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:08,889
Only your life.

628
00:48:35,456 --> 00:48:37,166
[Singing]

629
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:50,097
[Wailing]

630
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:54,016
[Mirri screaming]

631
00:49:08,322 --> 00:49:10,324
[Screaming continues]

632
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:41,731
[Chirruping]

633
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,822
[Soft snarls]

634
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:41,250
Blood of my blood.

635
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:45,003
[Hisses]

636
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,690
[Hisses]

637
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:16,201
[Shrieking]

638
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:26,128
[Shrieking continues]

639
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:33,128

00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:13,412
You need to drink, child.

00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:15,496
[She sighs]

3
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,793
And eat.

4
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,841
lsn't there anything else?

5
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:31,013
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.

6
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:33,347
People can't live on grass.

7
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,984
[Jorah] In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,

8
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:47,446
they say there are fields of ghost grass

9
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:50,781
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

10
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:53,327
lt murders all other grass.

11
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:55,870
The Dothraki believe that one day

12
00:02:55,954 --> 00:02:59,082
it will cover everything -
that's the way the world will end.

13
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:14,931
lt'll get easier.

14
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:24,483
[Neighs, snorts]

15
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:35,744
[Laughing]

16
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:53,679
Khaleesi!

17
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:55,639
Your hands.

18
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:09,193
We're still not far from Pentos,
Your Grace.

19
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:11,697
Master Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

20
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,489
You'd be more comfortable there.

21
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:16,368
l have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

22
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,747
l'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end
of the bargain and l have my crown.

23
00:04:20,872 --> 00:04:23,125
As you wish, Your Grace.

24
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,502
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

25
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:28,796
l suppose it is preferable to beheading.

26
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,466
What did Ned Stark want you for?

27
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:35,721
Buying from a slaver?

28
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:37,805
Selling to one.

29
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,849
Some poachers l caught on my land.

30
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:45,354
Under my reign, you won't be punished
for such nonsense.

31
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,315
You can rest assured of that.

32
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:56,449
[Dogs howling]

33
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:02,831
[Rooster crows, hen clucking]

00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:05,166
- [Moans]
- [Barking]

35
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:14,593
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

36
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:21,432
My mother's been looking for you.

37
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:23,685
We ride for King's Landing today.

38
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:26,812
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

39
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:29,231
and omer your sympathies.

40
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,776
What good will my sympathies do them?

41
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,490
None. But it is expected of you.

42
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:38,533
Your absence has already been noted.

43
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:40,618
The boy means nothing to me.

44
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:43,079
And l can't stand
the wailing of women.

45
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:45,248
[Whimpers]

46
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:47,209
One word and l'll hit you again.

47
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,918
l'm telling Mother!

48
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:52,380
Go! Tell her.

49
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:54,591
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark

50
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:56,634
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

51
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,553
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

52
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:02,891
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

53
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:05,185
You can't...

54
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,769
Do you understand?

55
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,820
The Prince will
remember that, little lord.

56
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:17,863
l hope so.

57
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:21,284
lf he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

58
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:27,207
Ah. Time for breakfast.

59
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:37,384
Bread. And two of those little fish.

60
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:40,803
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

61
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:45,474
And bacon, burnt black.

62
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:47,476
- Hyah.
- [Laughs]

63
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:50,439
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

64

ls Bran going to die?

65
00:06:58,697 --> 00:06:59,822
Apparently not.

66
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:06,538
- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.

67
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:17,716
lt's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

68
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:19,550
Only the gods know for certain.

69
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:22,094
All the rest of us can do is pray.

70
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:26,141
The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.

71
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,935
l still can't believe you're going.

72
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:30,103
lt's ridiculous, even for you.

73
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:31,939
Where's your sense of wonder?

74
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:36,151
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,

75
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:38,487
the wintry abode of the white walkers.

76
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,740
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

77
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:44,743
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

78
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:46,745
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

79
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,956
No, l just want to stand
on top of the Wall

80
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:50,873
and piss off the edge of the world.

81
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:54,961
The children don't need to hear your filth.

82
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,589
Come.

83
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:08,432
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

84
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:11,019
Give me a good, clean death any day.

85
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:15,899
Speaking for the grotesques,
l'd have to disagree.

86
00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:18,735
Death is so final, whereas life...

87
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,070
ah, life is full of possibilities.

88
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:26,659
l hope the boy does wake. l'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.

89

My dear brother,

90
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:33,874
there are times you make me wonder
whose side you're on.

91
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,127
My dear brother, you wound me.

92
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:38,671
You know how much
l love my family.

93
00:08:58,108 --> 00:08:59,276
Please.

94
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:02,653
Oh, l would have dressed, Your Grace.

95
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:05,114
This is your home. l'm your guest.

96
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,494
Handsome one, isn't he?

97
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:15,709
l lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

98
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,669
He was a fighter too -

99
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:19,879
tried to beat the fever that took him.

100
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,050
Forgive me.

101
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:26,011
lt's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

102
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:28,180
l never knew.

103
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:30,181
lt was years ago.

104
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:35,145
Robert was crazed,
beat his hands bloody on the wall,

105
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,648
all the things men do
to show you how much they care.

106
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,656
The boy looked just like him.

107
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:49,158
Such a little thing.

108
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:52,371
A bird without feathers.

109
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:57,541
They came to take his body away

110
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:02,256
and Robert held me.
l screamed and l battled, but he held me.

111
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:09,345
That little bundle.

112
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:13,558
They took him away
and l never saw him again.

113
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:15,935
Never have visited the crypt, never.

114
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:28,656

every morning and night

115
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,867
that she return your child to you.

116
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:34,704
l am grateful.

117
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,666
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

[Bellows pumping, fire crackling]

119
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,802

- l already have one.
- Good man.

121
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,810
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course l have.

122
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:40,436
At someone, l mean.

123
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:48,570
lt's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

124
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:51,864
You realise we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,

125
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:54,785
and some bone to keep it all standing.

126
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:59,122
Let me thank you ahead of time

127
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:01,999
for guarding us all from the perils
beyond the Wall -

128
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:04,670
wildlings and white walkers
and whatnot.

129
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:10,883
We're grateful to have good, strong men
like you protecting us.

130

for 8,OOO years.

Have you taken your vows, then?

133
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,857
Soon enough.

134
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:30,528
Give my regards to the Night's Watch.

135
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:34,699
l'm sure it will be thrilling to serve
in such an elite force. And if not...

136
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:38,119
it's only for life.

137
00:12:57,513 --> 00:12:59,558
Thank you, Nymeria.

My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

140
00:13:12,237 --> 00:13:15,198
Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

141

lt's good you've got help.

142
00:13:17,618 --> 00:13:19,201

l have something for you.

148
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:38,347
And it has to be packed very carefully.

149

A present?

150
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,142
Close the door.

151
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:57,074
This is no toy.

152
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,536
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

153
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,501
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

154
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,670
l had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

155
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:12,046
lt won't hack a man's head off,

156
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,049
but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.

157
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:16,843
- l can be quick.
- You'll have to work at it every day.

158
00:14:18,302 --> 00:14:19,762
How does it feel?

159
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:22,974
Do you like the balance?

l think so.

161
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:28,438
First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.

162
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:30,440
l know which end to use.

163
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:38,031
l'm going to miss you.

164
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:40,993
Careful.

165
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:55,172
All the best swords have names, you know.

166
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:00,429
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

167
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:04,141
l've got a needle of my own.

168
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,991
l came to say goodbye to Bran.

169
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:22,700
You've said it.

170
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:36,422
l wish l could be here when you wake up.

171
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,262
l'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

172
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:43,722
l'm taking the black.

173
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,483
l know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

174
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:59,279
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

175
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:03,867
l'll know my way around by then.

176
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:06,328
l'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

177
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:14,419
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.

178
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:31,978
l want you...

179
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,771
to leave.

180
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:35,041
1T years ago

181
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,586
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

182
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:43,133
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

183
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,387
And now you're leaving again.

184
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:51,767
l have no choice.

185
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:55,811
That's what men always say
when honour calls.

186
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:59,273
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

187
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,235
You do have a choice.

188
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:05,947
And you've made it.

189
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:12,037
Cat...

190
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,586
l can't do it, Ned.

191
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,508
l really can't.

192
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,092
You can.

193
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:29,804
You must.

194
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:56,122
You've said goodbye to Bran?

195
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:58,250
He's not going to die. l know it.

196
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,543
You Starks are hard to kill.

197
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:03,088
My mother?

198
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:05,756
- She was very kind.
- Good.

199
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:09,720
Next time l see you,
you'll be all in black.

200
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:11,972
lt was always my colour.

201
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:14,933
Farewell, Snow.

202
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:16,685
And you, Stark.

203
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,240
There's great honour serving
in the Night's Watch.

204
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:16,869
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

205
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:19,790
And you are a Stark.

206
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:22,000
You might not have my name,

207
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,127
but you have my blood.

208
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:32,761
ls my mother alive?

209
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,057
Does she know about me?
Where l am, where l'm going?

210
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:39,768
Does she care?

211
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:44,063
I
The next time we see each other

212
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:46,191
we'll talk about your mother.

213
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,109
Hmm?

214
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:49,695
l promise.

215
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,854
[Horse neighs]

216
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:32,279
Gods, this is country!

217
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:37,533
l've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

218
00:21:39,785 --> 00:21:42,039
l've half a mind to go with you.

219
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:46,835
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

220
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:50,297
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

221
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:53,090
- You should have asked me 20 years ago.
- [Chuckles]

222
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:55,968
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

223
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:58,347
we never had the chance to be young.

224
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,098
l recall a few chances.

225
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:02,391
[Laughing]

226
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:06,605
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

227
00:22:06,687 --> 00:22:08,648
That common girl of yours?

228
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:11,568
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

229
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:13,861
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

230
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:17,657
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.

231
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:19,408
And her tits.

232
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:22,870
Yours was, er... Aleena?

233
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:25,874
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?

234
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:27,917
Your bastard's mother?

235
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:31,922
- Wylla.
- That's it.

236
00:22:32,004 --> 00:22:34,090
She must have been a rare wench

237
00:22:34,258 --> 00:22:37,135
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honour.

238
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:39,303
You never told me what she looked like.

239
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:41,598
Nor will l.

240
00:22:44,184 --> 00:22:46,102
We were at war.

241
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:48,981
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

242
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:52,149
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

243
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:57,321
l swear if l weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

244
00:22:57,446 --> 00:23:00,783
The worst thing about your coronation -

245
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,910
l'll never get to hit you again.

246
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:07,707
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

247
00:23:11,752 --> 00:23:13,714
There was a rider in the night.

248
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:23,307
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

249
00:23:23,432 --> 00:23:25,266
What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

250
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:27,685
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

251
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:29,812
and a bold man to wield it.

252
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:31,732
She's little more than a child.

253
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:35,068
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

254
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:38,864
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

255
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:42,283
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

256
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,703
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

257
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:46,829
the woman l loved.

258
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:50,000
l'll kill every Targaryen l get my hands on.

259
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:52,043
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

260
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,796
This Khal Drogo,

261
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:56,798
it's said he has 100,OOO men
in his horde.

262
00:23:56,924 --> 00:23:59,675
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

263
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,387
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

264
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:04,473
They have no ships, Robert.

265
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:07,559
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

266
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:12,396
lf the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

267
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:15,149
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

268
00:24:16,734 --> 00:24:20,030
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

269
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:27,119
There's a war coming, Ned.

270
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:31,375
l don't know when,
l don't know who we'll be fighting,

271
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,960
but it's coming.

272
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:38,214
[Laughter]

273
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:00,611
[Whimpering]

274
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:05,032
[Grunting]

275
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:39,568
[Fox barking]

276
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:46,782
Sit.

277
00:25:46,908 --> 00:25:48,659
You'll be fed.

278
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:54,416
Untie them.

279
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:57,793
Ah, rapers.

280
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:03,759
They were given a choice, no doubt -
castration or the Wall.

281
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:06,136
Most choose the knife.

282
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:13,685
Not impressed by your new brothers?

283
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:18,397
Lovely thing about the Watch -

284
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:21,859
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

285
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,745
Why do you read so much?

286
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,999
Look at me and tell me what you see.

287
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:39,211
ls this a trick?

288
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:43,048
What you see is a dwarf.

289
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:46,342
lf l'd been born a peasant they might've
Ieft me out in the woods to die.

290
00:26:46,385 --> 00:26:50,554
Alas, l was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

291
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:52,683
Things are expected of me.

292
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:55,226
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

293
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,354
Until your brother killed that king.

294
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:06,905
Yes, until my brother killed him.

295
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:11,451
Life is full of these little ironies.

296
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:15,246
My sister married the new king, and...

297
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:17,832
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

298
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:23,672
l must do my part for the honour of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

299
00:27:25,464 --> 00:27:27,384
But how?

300
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:30,303
Well, my brother has his sword

301
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:31,679
and l have my mind,

302
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:35,850
and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

303
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:38,604
That's why l read so much, Jon Snow.

304
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:44,525
And you?

305
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,820
What's your story, bastard?

306
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:51,992
Ask me nicely
and maybe l'll tell you, dwarf.

307
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:58,790
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

308
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:03,377
off to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,

309
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:07,299
alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

310
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:09,050
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

311
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:12,471
Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

312
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:16,140
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

313
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:18,518
You're a smart boy.

314
00:28:18,644 --> 00:28:21,104
You don't believe that nonsense.

315
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:31,531
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

316
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:45,796
[Wind howling]

317
00:28:46,421 --> 00:28:48,005
[Creak]

318
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:10,153
lt's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

319
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:14,073
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

320
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:17,578
Talk to Poole about it.

321
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:22,791
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

322
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:25,460
We need a new steward,

323
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:28,629
and there are several other
appointments that require

324
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:32,634
- our immediate attention.
- l don't care about appointments!

325
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:33,801
[Footsteps]

326
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:35,887
l'll make the appointments.

327
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:40,642
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

328
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:42,769
Very good, my lord.

329
00:29:45,062 --> 00:29:46,522
My lady.

330
00:29:46,647 --> 00:29:48,733
[Distant howling]

331
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:56,742
[Distant barking, howling]

332
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,829
When was the last time you left this room?

333
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:04,457
l have to take care of him.

334
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,292
He's not going to die, Mother.

335
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:08,211
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

336
00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:09,378
What if he's wrong?

337
00:30:09,463 --> 00:30:12,883
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

338
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,718
- He's six.
- [Barking and howling continues]

339
00:30:15,843 --> 00:30:19,056
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

340
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:21,515
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!

341
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:23,644
l can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

342
00:30:23,726 --> 00:30:26,812
- [Howling, barking]
- [Animal shrieking]

343
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:28,982
Fire.

344
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:32,277
- [People shouting]
- You stay here. l'll come back.

345
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,695
[Bell ringing]

346
00:30:34,737 --> 00:30:37,448
[Barking, people shouting]

347
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:52,505
You're not supposed to be here.

348
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,216
No one is supposed to be here.

349
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,636
lt's a mercy.

350
00:30:57,718 --> 00:30:59,596
He's dead already.

351
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:03,058
No!

352
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,768

[Animals bleating]

363
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:13,878
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

364
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:16,881
Everywhere? Even in the East?

365
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:19,967
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

366
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:23,012
- It is known.
- It is known.

367
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:27,016
A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

368
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:29,269
The moon?

369
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:32,021
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

370
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:34,733
that once there were two moons in the sky.

371
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:38,779
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,

372
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:41,865
and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

373
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:43,825
and they drank the sun's fire.

374
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:46,912
[Chuckles] Moon is no egg.

375
00:32:46,954 --> 00:32:49,790
Moon is goddess - wife of sun.

376
00:32:49,915 --> 00:32:52,416
- It is known.
- It is known.

377
00:32:54,211 --> 00:32:55,878
Leave me with her.

378
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:07,765
Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?

379
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,394
Men like to talk when they're happy.

380
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,563
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

381
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:16,942
How old were you?

382
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:19,569
l was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.

383
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:21,280
Nine?!

384
00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:25,325
l did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

385
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,287
First you must learn.

386
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:34,626
Can you teach me
how to make the khal happy?

387
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:37,838
Yes.

388
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:39,673
Will it take three years?

389
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
No.

390
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:48,682

Welcome.

393
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:40,376
[Catelyn] What l am about to tell you
must remain between us.

394
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:44,463
l don't think Bran fell from that tower.

395
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:47,676
l think he was thrown.

396
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:51,805
The boy was always
surefooted before.

397
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:54,765
Someone tried to kill him twice.

398
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,727
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

399
00:35:57,852 --> 00:36:00,522
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

400
00:36:00,606 --> 00:36:03,274
- Saw what, my lady?
- l don't know.

401
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:07,153
But l would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

402
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:10,531
We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.

403
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:12,867
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

404
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:15,287
lt's too fine a weapon for such a man.

405
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,664
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

406
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:20,584
Someone gave it to him.

407
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:25,631
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

408
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:27,256
lf it's war they want...

409
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:29,508
lf it comes to that,
you know l'll stand behind you.

410
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:32,763
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

411
00:36:32,888 --> 00:36:34,388
Hmm?

412
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:37,475
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

413
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,602
We don't know the truth yet.

414
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:42,064
Lord Stark must be told of this.

415
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:44,983
l don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

416
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:46,984
- l'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

417
00:36:47,068 --> 00:36:50,280
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

418
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:52,240
- l will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

419
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:53,867
l must.

420
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:57,537
l'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

421
00:36:57,704 --> 00:37:00,164
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

422
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:02,417
l don't want the Lannisters
to know l'm coming.

423
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:04,044
Let me accompany you at least.

424
00:37:04,169 --> 00:37:07,171
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place
for a woman alone.

425
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:13,345
What about Bran?

426
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:17,890
l have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

427
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:22,479
Bran's life is in their hands now.

428
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:23,332
No, Khaleesi.

429
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:26,292
You must look in his eyes always.

430
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:28,502
Love comes in at the eyes.

431
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:32,925
lt is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

432
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:34,885
with nothing but her eyes.

433
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:37,178
Finish a man?

434
00:38:38,805 --> 00:38:40,973
Oh.

435
00:38:42,142 --> 00:38:45,687
Kings travelled across the world
for a night with Irogenia.

436
00:38:45,812 --> 00:38:48,439
Magisters sold their palaces.

437
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:51,984
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

438
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:55,655
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

439
00:38:55,738 --> 00:38:58,825
and she refused them all.

440
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:02,162
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

441
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:03,955
l... l don't think

442
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,541
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

443
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,919
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

444
00:39:09,044 --> 00:39:11,046
Men want what they've never had.

445
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:14,548
And the Dothraki take slaves like
a hound takes a bitch.

446
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:17,928
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

447
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:31,399
Then don't make love like a slave.

448
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,410
[Gasps] Very good, Khaleesi.

449
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:44,537
Out there he is the mighty khal,

450
00:39:45,205 --> 00:39:48,542
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

451
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:50,751
l... l don't think

452
00:39:50,876 --> 00:39:53,379
that this is the Dothraki way.

453
00:39:53,504 --> 00:39:55,548
lf he wanted the Dothraki way,

454
00:39:56,341 --> 00:39:58,468
why did he marry you?

455
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:48,309
No.

456
00:40:52,272 --> 00:40:53,731

461
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:57,856
Or is it him there making you shake?

462
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:00,399
He frightens me too.

463
00:43:00,566 --> 00:43:03,028

l'm sorry if l offended you, ser.

465
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:13,497
Why won't he speak to me?

466
00:43:13,664 --> 00:43:16,582
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

467
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:19,711
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

468
00:43:19,836 --> 00:43:22,588
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

Does the hound frighten you?

Away with you, dog.

00:47:00,973 --> 00:47:03,059
Go on. Run.

529
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:08,314
Go! Leave now!

530
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:12,861
- It's a direwolf.
- l'll check down here.

531
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:22,037
- [Whines]
- [Man] l think l heard a noise.

532
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:25,207
Go!

533
00:47:37,426 --> 00:47:40,013
- [Dogs barking]
- [Ned] Arya!

534
00:47:41,013 --> 00:47:42,348
[Man] Arya!

535
00:47:43,975 --> 00:47:45,017
[Ned] Arya!

536
00:47:45,769 --> 00:47:48,021
[Man] Arya!

537
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:50,691
Arya!

538
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:53,026
[Man] Arya!

539
00:47:53,151 --> 00:47:55,236
My lord!

540
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,405
My Lord! They've found her.

541
00:47:57,446 --> 00:48:00,033
- She's unharmed.
- [Man] Arya!

542
00:48:00,117 --> 00:48:02,452
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

543
00:48:02,577 --> 00:48:04,412
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

544
00:48:04,495 --> 00:48:06,622
- [Man] Arya!
- Right, get back.

545
00:48:06,747 --> 00:48:09,417
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

546
00:48:09,459 --> 00:48:11,752
Back! Back to the inn!

547
00:48:12,713 --> 00:48:14,506
All back!

548
00:48:22,388 --> 00:48:24,182
l'm sorry, l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

549
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:25,809
- Are you hurt?
- No.

550
00:48:25,934 --> 00:48:28,394
Oh, it's all right.

551
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:32,858
What is the meaning of this?

552
00:48:32,983 --> 00:48:35,026
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

553
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:36,903
How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?

554
00:48:37,028 --> 00:48:38,446
Quiet, woman.

555
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:42,700
Sorry, Ned. l never meant to frighten the girl.

556
00:48:42,783 --> 00:48:45,162
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

557
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,916
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

558
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:51,209
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

559
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:53,211
That's not true!

560
00:48:53,294 --> 00:48:55,881
She just... bit him a little.

561
00:48:56,714 --> 00:48:59,383
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

562
00:48:59,468 --> 00:49:02,678
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

563
00:49:02,803 --> 00:49:04,347
That's not what happened!

564
00:49:04,472 --> 00:49:07,600
Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

565
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:08,894
- Liar!
- Shut up!

566
00:49:08,977 --> 00:49:10,437
[Robert] Enough!

567
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:13,481
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

568
00:49:13,522 --> 00:49:15,816
Seven hells!
What am l to make of this?

569
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,780
- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed, asleep.

570
00:49:20,863 --> 00:49:22,908
She's not.

571
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,452
Sansa, come here, darling.

572
00:49:28,622 --> 00:49:30,624
[Murmuring]

573
00:49:36,463 --> 00:49:38,298
Now, child...

574
00:49:39,298 --> 00:49:41,260
tell me what happened.

575
00:49:41,343 --> 00:49:43,428
Tell it all and tell it true.

576
00:49:43,553 --> 00:49:46,013
lt's a great crime to lie to a king.

577
00:49:54,564 --> 00:49:56,691
l don't know.

578
00:49:56,816 --> 00:49:59,820
l don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

579
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:03,281
- l didn't see.
- Liar!

580
00:50:03,406 --> 00:50:04,825
- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!

581
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,202
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!

582
00:50:07,327 --> 00:50:10,789
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

583
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:12,916
- l want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

584
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:14,501
whip her through the streets?

585
00:50:14,584 --> 00:50:17,671
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

586
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:20,423
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

587
00:50:21,966 --> 00:50:25,512
You let that little girl disarm you?

588
00:50:31,727 --> 00:50:34,687
Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.

589
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:37,608
- l'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

590
00:50:38,899 --> 00:50:40,818
[Cersei] And what of the direwolf?

591
00:50:41,653 --> 00:50:44,030
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

592
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:49,493
l'd forgot the damned wolf.

593
00:50:49,577 --> 00:50:52,247
I
We found no trace of the direwolf
Your Grace.

594
00:50:52,414 --> 00:50:55,584
No? So be it.

595
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:57,752
We have another wolf.

596
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:02,758
As you will.

597
00:51:02,883 --> 00:51:06,135
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolfs no pet.

598
00:51:06,218 --> 00:51:08,430
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

599
00:51:09,722 --> 00:51:12,267
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

600
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:14,977
No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

601
00:51:15,062 --> 00:51:17,189
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

602
00:51:17,272 --> 00:51:20,233
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

603
00:51:20,316 --> 00:51:22,778
Please, please, it wasn't Lady!

604
00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:24,613
ls this your command?

605
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,198
Your Grace?

606
00:51:32,745 --> 00:51:33,747
[Door slams]

607
00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:37,167
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

608
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:39,252
Ser Ilyn, do me the honour.

609
00:51:39,377 --> 00:51:40,796
No.

610
00:51:41,754 --> 00:51:43,798
Jory...

611
00:51:45,258 --> 00:51:47,301
take the girls to their rooms.

612
00:51:51,597 --> 00:51:54,017
- [Sansa sobbing]
- If it must be done,

613
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,102
then l'll do it myself.

614
00:51:56,185 --> 00:51:58,272
ls this some trick?

615
00:51:58,354 --> 00:52:00,439
The wolf is of the North.

616
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:04,403
She deserves better than a butcher.

617
00:52:37,894 --> 00:52:41,439
The butcher's boy -
you rode him down?

618
00:52:41,564 --> 00:52:43,566
He ran.

619
00:52:43,691 --> 00:52:45,276
Not very fast.

620
00:53:03,629 --> 00:53:05,004
[Whines]

621
00:53:16,642 --> 00:53:18,809
[Whines]

622
00:53:32,115 --> 00:53:34,075
[Whimpers]

623
00:53:41,124 --> 00:53:43,626
[Soft groaning]

624
00:53:52,885 --> 00:53:55,430
[Lady whines]

625
00:53:55,555 --> 00:53:57,890
[lnhales]

626
00:53:58,015 --> 00:54:00,059
[Lady yelps]

627
00:54:10,015 --> 00:54:15,059

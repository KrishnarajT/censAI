1
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,615
[Breathing]

2
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,296
[Varys] You've seen better days, my lord.

3
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,592
Another visit?

4
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,346
lt seems you're my last friend.

5
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,306
No, no, many still love you.

6
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:25,687
Sansa came to court this morning
to plead for your life.

7
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:29,566
On her knees begging for me. Hm!

8
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,818
Did you laugh with the others?

9
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,531
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing l want.

10
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,533
l don't know what you want.

11
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,283
l've given up trying to guess.

12
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,914
When l was still a boy -

13
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,793
before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -

14
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:52,381
l travelled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

15
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:57,009
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

16
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,888
The same is true at court.

17
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,265
l am the master of whisperers.

18
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,770
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

19
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,855
l'm a good actor, my lord.

20
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,234
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

21
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,360
l could.

22
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,820
But will l?

23
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:18,282
- No.
- [Laughs]

24
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,366
As l said, l'm no hero.

25
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,243
What do you want? Tell me.

26
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,204
No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want?

27
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,917
Peace.

28
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:35,090
Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.

29
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,550
Fighting for his father's freedom.

30
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,844
Robb?

31
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,763
He's just a boy.

32
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,098
Boys have been conquerors before.

33
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:50,771
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.

34
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,650
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.

35
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,944
He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

36
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:01,449
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.

37
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,117
[Varys tuts]

38
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:08,289
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.

39
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,919
Cersei is no fool.

40
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,338
She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.

41
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,009
You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men,

42
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,718
who crippled my son?

43
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,762
l want you to serve the realm!

44
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,598
Tell the queen you will confess
your vile treason,

45
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,725
tell your son to lay down his sword

46
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,021
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

47
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,108
Cersei knows you as a man of honour.

48
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,988
lf you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

49
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:43,699
l believe she will allow you
to take the black

50
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,329
and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

51
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,747
[Chuckles]

52
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,375
You think my life
is some precious thing to me?

53
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,213
That l would trade my honour
for a few more years of...

54
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,965
Of what?

55
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,930
You grew up with actors.

56
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,393
You learned their craft and you learnt it well.

57
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,855
But l grew up with soldiers.

58
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,317
l learned how to die a long time ago.

59
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,113
Pity.

60
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,074
Such a pity.

61
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,334
What of your daughter's life, my lord?

62
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,879
ls that a precious thing to you?

63
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,843
[Water dripping]

64
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,394
[Cawing]

65
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,860
[Arrow whooshes]

66
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,214
lt's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

67
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,093
- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
- [Catelyn] Keep shooting them down.

68
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,221
We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.

69
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,350
He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

70
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:35,228
[Greatjon] Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

71
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,521
Look.

72
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,483
[Robb] Father rots in a dungeon.

73
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,694
How long before they take his head?

74
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,822
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

75
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,408
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

76
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,452
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

77
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,956
[Greatjon] Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

78
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,750
The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,

79
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,004
and for 600 years
they have never failed to exact their toll.

80
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,339
Have my horse saddled and ready.

81
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,593
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he likes.

82
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,512
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

83
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,269
My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

84
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,646
Whatever it took.

85
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:22,317
lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

86
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,610
l agree.

87
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,822
- l'll go.
- [Theon] You can't!

88
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:31,242
l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl.
He would never harm me.

89
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,786
[Greatjon] Unless there was a profit in it.

90
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,336
What do you want?

91
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,048
lt is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.

92
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,884
Oh, spare me.

93
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,096
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

94
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,223
What am l supposed to do with you?

95
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,350
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...

96
00:07:56,435 --> 00:08:02,524
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until l die. Do l look dead to you?

97
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,403
- Father, please...
- l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

98
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:11,949
Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.

99
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,497
All right, you come forward.

100
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,177
[Smacking kiss]

101
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,678
There.
Now that l've observed the courtesies,

102
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,182
perhaps my sons will do me the honour
of shutting their mouths.

103
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,524
ls there somewhere we can talk?

104
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,692
We're talking right now.

105
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,240
Fine.

106
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,908
Out! All of you!

107
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,629
- Oh!
- You too.

108
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,179
You see that?

109
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,349
Fifteen, she is.

110
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,268
A little flower.

111
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,813
And her honey's all mine. [Chuckles]

112
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,568
l'm sure she will give you many sons.

113
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,322
Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.

114
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,365
He is quite ill, my lord.

115
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,536
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

116
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,913
Or the one before that.

117
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,542
Your family has always pissed on me.

118
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,544
- My lord, l...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

119
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,091
The fine Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.

120
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,094
- l'm sure there were reasons...
- l didn't need reasons.

121
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:58,932
l needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

122
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,479
Why are you here?

123
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,149
To ask you...

124
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,527
to open your gates, my lord...

125
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,157
so my son and his bannermen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.

126
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,326
- Why should l let him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

127
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,955
you would see that he has
20,OOO men outside your walls.

128
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,458
They'll be 20,OOO corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

129
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,878
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

130
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,422
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

131
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,383
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

132
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,802
You swore an oath to my father.

133
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,014
Oh, yes, l said some words.

134
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,308
And l swore oaths to the crown too,
if l remember right.

135
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,686
Joffrey's king now,

136
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,441
which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

137
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:55,364
lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish,
l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

138
00:10:55,447 --> 00:11:00,369
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

139
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:06,250
Give me one good reason why l should
waste a single thought on any of you?

140
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,043
- [Man] And...engage!
- [Wind howls]

141
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,254
[Door slams]

142
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,383
When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?

143
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,677
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

144
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,514
You'll be ready for this, then.

145
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,351
l thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...

146
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,898
so l had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

147
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,693
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.

148
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,373
This is Valyrian steel.

149
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,044
lt was my father's sword,
his father before him.

150
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:55,591
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

151
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,717
lt was meant for my son Jorah.

152
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:03,557
He brought dishonour to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

153
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,893
before he fled from Westeros.

154
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,062
- My lord, you honour me, but l can't...
- Oh, you can.

155
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,899
And you will.

156
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,903
l wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.

157
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,739
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

158
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,452
So you'll take it.
l'll hear no more about it.

159
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,288
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.

160
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,956
Right.

161
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:34,962
Now, don't think this means l approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

162
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,591
That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

163
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,928
l'll apologise to Ser Alliser tonight.

164
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,474
No, you won't.
l sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

165
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,602
The hand that your wolf tore off
that thing's wrist...

166
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,980
l've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this...

167
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,982
boy king.

168
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,945
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

169
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:04,116
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.

170
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,827
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...

171
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,288
and bring me my supper.

172
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,999
Yes, my lord.

173
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,888
- Well done.
- Well done.

174
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,642
You earned that, Snow.

175
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,648
Well done.

176
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,571
Go on, let's have a look.

177
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,990
- At what?
- [Grenn] The sword! Show us the sword.

178
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,033
[All] Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

179
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,370
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

180
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,998
[Laughter, cheering]

181
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,294
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

182
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,337
[Laughter, excited chatter]

183
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,301
Come on,
l want to have a look at it in the light.

184
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,181
[Pyp] Give it here!

185
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,182
What is it?

186
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,309
- l...
- Look at its eyes.

187
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,977
- Give it.
- l can't.

188
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,563
You can't what?

189
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,856
l...

190
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,153
l'm really not supposed to say.

191
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,905
And yet you really want to say.

192
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,990
You want to say that...?

193
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,080
There was a raven.

194
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,081
l read the message to Maester Aemon.

195
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,336
lt's your brother Robb.

196
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,213
What?

197
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,881
What about him?

198
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,842
He's heading south.

199
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,761
To war.

200
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,808
All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.

201
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,230
l should be there.

202
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,899
l should be with him.

203
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,568
[Hoofbeats approaching]

204
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,042
lf we do that, they'll never get back across.

205
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,586
[Robb] Well?

206
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,380
What did he say?

207
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,051
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

208
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,097
- His men are yours, as well.
- [Greatjon] Huh.

209
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,976
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.

210
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,436
What does he want in return?

211
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:40,816
You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.

212
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,777
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.

213
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,405
And?

214
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,576
And Arya...

215
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,495
will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.

216
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,290
- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

217
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,504
And?

218
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,673
And...

219
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,967
when the fighting is done...

220
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,431
you will marry one of his daughters.

221
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,517
Whichever you prefer.

222
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,020
He has a number
he thinks will be...suitable.

223
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,023
l see.

224
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,193
- Did you get a look at his daughters?
- [Snickering]

225
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,695
l did.

226
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,155
And?

227
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,075
One was...

228
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,750
Do you consent?

229
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,461
- Can l refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.

230
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,634
Then l consent.

231
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,846
[Chuckles]

232
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,171
[Cawing]

233
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,640
Sam said you wanted to see me?

234
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,142
l did indeed.

235
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,229
Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.

236
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:50,903
Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch

237
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,074
take no wives and father no children?

238
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,867
No.

239
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,702
So they will not love.

240
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,249
Love is the death of duty.

241
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,170
lf the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...

242
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,588
between honour on the one hand...

243
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,174
I
and those he loves on the other

244
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,550
what would he do?

245
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:17,763
He... He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

246
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,019
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,OOO.

247
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,730
Most of us are not so strong.

248
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,441
What is honour...

249
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,277
compared to a woman's love?

250
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,778
And what is duty...

251
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:36,450
against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?

252
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,911
Or a brother's smile?

253
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,790
Sam told you.

254
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,919
We're all human.

255
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,255
Oh, we all do our duty
when there's no cost to it.

256
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,133
Honour comes easy then.

257
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,718
Yet...

258
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,761
sooner or later...

259
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,805
in every man's life...

260
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,933
there comes a day when it is not easy.

261
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,103
A day when he must choose.

262
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,981
And this is my day?

263
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,151
ls that what you're saying?

264
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,363
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

265
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,365
- l know.
- You do not know.

266
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,244
No one knows.

267
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,998
l may be a bastard,

268
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,625
but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

269
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,751
[Chuckles]

270
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:36,175
The gods were cruel
when they saw fit to test my vows.

271
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,302
They waited till l was old.

272
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:43,808
What could l do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

273
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,353
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

274
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,355
l was helpless...

275
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,775
blind, frail.

276
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,528
But...

277
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:59,115
when l heard they had
killed my brother's son...

278
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,285
and his poor son...

279
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,827
and the children!

280
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,247
Even the little children.

281
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,000
Who are you?

282
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,923
My father was Maekar,

283
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,134
the first of his name.

284
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,512
My brother Aegon reigned after him...

285
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:24,473
when l had refused the throne.

286
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,019
And he was followed by his son Aerys...

287
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:31,064
whom they called the Mad King.

288
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,816
You're Aemon Targaryen.

289
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,613
l'm a maester of the Citadel,

290
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,909
bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

291
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,957
l will not tell you...to stay or go.

292
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,627
You must make that choice yourself...

293
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,963
and live with it for the rest of your days.

294
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:00,969
As l have.

295
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,449
[Speaks Dothraki] *Khal anni...*
My lord...

296
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,076
[Speaks Dothraki] *Shekh ma shieraki anni...*
My sun and stars...

297
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,248
Drogo.

298
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,584
[Mutters]

299
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,336
[Grunts]

300
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,965
[Speaks Dothraki] *Sajo anni.*
My Horse.

301
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,301
[Speaks Dothraki] *Sajo... anni.*
My... Horse.

302
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,221
[Speaks Dothraki] *Qoy qoyi...*
Blood of my blood...

303
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:48,267
[Speaks Dothraki] *Vos, anha'th dothrak*
No, l must ride.

304
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,769
[Qotho speaks Dothraki] *Me arthas hrazefoon mae.*
He fell from his horse.

305
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,440
[Speaks Dothraki] *Khal fini laz vos dothrao, vos khal.*
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

306
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,693
[Speaks Dothraki] *Me haqa, vos ale. Me zigeree mithrat.*
He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest.

307
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:03,073
[Speaks Dothraki] *Kisha ray hezhahish chek asshekh. Kisha avimithreraki jinne.*
We've ridden far enough today. We will camp here.

308
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,366
[Speaks Dothraki] *Jinne vos gache vimithrerat.*
This is no place to camp.

309
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,662
[Speaks Dothraki] *Chiori vos assoo kisha. Vos Khaleesi akka.*
A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.

310
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,790
[Speaks Dothraki] *Kisha avimithreraki jinne. Asti morea me Khal Drogo asso moon.*
We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

311
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,419
[Speaks Dothraki] *Shafka vos assoo anna zhey Khaleesi.*
You do not command me Khaleesi.

312
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,630
[Speaks Dothraki] *Ezi Mirri Maaz Duur. Fichi mae anhaan.*
Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.

313
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,383
[Speaks Dothraki] *Maegi? Anha afichak shafkea nharees zhey Khaleesi.*
The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

314
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:27,263
[Speaks Dothraki] *Fichi mae anhaan ozisa che Khal Drogo achara kifindirgi yer ziganeso anhaan.*
Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you defied me.

315
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,314
Hyah! Hyah!

316
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,755
[Kevan] Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins

317
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,215
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

318
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,843
They're a day's march north.

319
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,346
The boy may lack experience and sense,

320
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,932
but he does have a certain mindless...

321
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,602
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

322
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,232
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

323
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,734
l do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

324
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,903
otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

325
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,406
The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battle axes.

326
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,992
Heavy black steel, double-sided.

327
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,912
Shagga likes axes.

328
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:36,750
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

329
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,417
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

330
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:41,171
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

331
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,632
[Kevan] They do seem rather ferocious.

332
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,927
[Tyrion] Ferocious?

333
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:52,766
Last night... a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

334
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:56,603
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.

335
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,355
Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping off the dead man's cock,

336
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,609
I
which was fortunate, but even still
Ulf is demanding blood money,

337
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,320
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

338
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,575
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

339
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:13,202
Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war effort.

340
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,663
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

341
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,297
lt appears l'm not hungry after all.

342
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,964
Excuse me, my lords.

343
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,190
Where did you find one so pretty
at this hour?

344
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,442
- l took her.
- Took her?

345
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,612
- From whom?
- From, uh...

346
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,529
Ser... What's his name?

347
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:54,493
- l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

348
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,873
He said something.

349
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:05,713
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

350
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,090
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

351
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:12,887
Oh, well. [Sighs]

352
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:18,309
l, uh...
think l'll go and find myself one.

353
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,316
Who are you?

354
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,777
Who would you like me to be?

355
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,569
What did your mother call you?

356
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:31,781
Shae. What did your mother call you?

357
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,242
My mother died giving birth to me.

358
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:37,996
ls that why l'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

359
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,415
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

360
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,167
For...

361
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,505
What do you want from me?

362
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,383
What do l want from you?

363
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,469
[Sighs] l want you to share my tent.

364
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:55,556
l want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

365
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,224
rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.

366
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,395
l want you to take no other man to bed
for as long as we're together.

367
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:07,067
And l want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

368
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,193
Which it may well be.

369
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:10,863
And what do l get?

370
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,573
One - safety.

371
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,742
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

372
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:20,538
Two - the pleasure of my company,

373
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,250
which l have heard is spectacular.

374
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,544
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

375
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,211
And three...

376
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,383
more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

377
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:35,345
Do you accept my proposal?

378
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,241
Let's start with your last night in this world.

379
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,721
[Muttering]

380
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,772
[Muttering]

381
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,609
[Jorah] Khaleesi.

382
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:32,736
Come.

383
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,281
He's very strong.

384
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:40,117
No one understands how strong he is.

385
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,884
[Daenerys gasps]

386
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,140
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

387
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:04,893
He can't. l won't let him.

388
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:08,105
Even a queen doesn't have that power.

389
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:14,236
We must go quickly.
l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

390
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:18,406
- l won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

391
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,491
[Speaks Dothraki] *Rides...*
Doth...

392
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,326
Even if...

393
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,830
Even if he dies...

394
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,375
why would l run?

395
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:34,088
l am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.

396
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,342
This isn't Westeros, where men honour blood.

397
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:42,055
Here they only honour strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

398
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,892
Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.

399
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,019
He won't want any rivals.

400
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:51,856
Your boy will be plucked from your breast
and given to the dogs.

401
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,693
l won't... leave him.

402
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,413
The wound has festered.

403
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:10,500
[Speaks Dothraki] *Yer et jin zhey maegi.*
You did this witch.

404
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,419
[Speaks Dothraki] *Nakhi*
Stop it!

405
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,086
[Speaks Dothraki] *Anha vos zalok meme nem azzisa.*
l don't want her hurt.

406
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:19,384
[Speaks Dothraki] *Vos? Vos? Hash shafka vos zali meme nem azzisa?*
No? No? You don't want her hurt?

407
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:27,351
[Speaks Dothraki] *Zali mekisha vos azzisaki shafka akka. Shafka azh jin maegaan frakhat khales kishi.*
Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

408
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,104
[Jorah speaks Dothraki] *Javrathi lekh. Me zin Khaleesi shafki.*
Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.

409
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,023
[Qotho speaks Dothraki] *Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.*
Only while the blood of my blood lives.

410
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:41,990
[Speaks Dothraki] *Affin me drivoe, me vosi.*
When he dies, she is nothing.

411
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:53,085
[Speaks Dothraki] *Anha vosoon avvos. Anha qoy zhavvorsi.*
l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.

412
00:29:54,752 --> 00:30:00,592
[Speaks Dothraki] *Ei zhavvorsa drivi, zhey Khaleesi.*
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

413
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,644
l think you should wear
your armour tonight, ser.

414
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,438
l think you're right.

415
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:22,655
- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.

416
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,991
He's beyond the healer's skills.

417
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,493
All l can do is ease his path.

418
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:29,788
Save him and l will free you. l swear it.

419
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,000
You must know a way.

420
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:34,835
Some...

421
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:37,546
Some magic.

422
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,340
There is a spell.

423
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:44,720
Some would say death is cleaner.

424
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,315
Do it.

425
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,901
Save him.

426
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,819
- There is a price.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.

427
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,198
lt's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.

428
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:06,325
Only death pays for life.

429
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,371
My death?

430
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:14,249
No, not your death, Khaleesi.

431
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,627
Bring me his horse.

432
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,432
[Whinnying]

433
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,903
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

434
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,323
- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.

435
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,367
This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

436
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:53,079
l am your khaleesi.
l tell you what is forbidden.

437
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:54,705
[Recites spell]

438
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,799
Go. Now.

439
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:06,801
- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.

440
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,095
Take her!

441
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:17,895
You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

442
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,566
The dead will dance here tonight.

What have you done?

448
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:06,819
l have to save him.

449
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:10,199
We could have been 10 miles
away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.

450
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,284
- You would have been safe.

This must not be.

Nothing good will come of this.

[Speaks Dothraki] *Vos! Yer laz vos.*
No, you can't.

- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

- Just used to it.
- Drink.

477
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,077
[Tyrion] Let's play a new game.

478
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,164
There's a Braavosi knife game
l could teach you.

479
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:26,376
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

480
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:29,003
- Not if you win.
- No!

481
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,672
No fire games, no knife games.

00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,637
- Let's do something l'm good at.
- What are you good at?

l happen to be a great judge of character.

484
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,974
- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

485
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:45,186
Here's how it works -
l make a statement about your past.

486
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:48,440
lf l'm right, you drink.
If l'm wrong, l drink.

487
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:51,443
And no lying.
l'll know if you're lying.

488

Fine. Bronn first.

490
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:01,911
Your father beat you.

00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,545
But my mother hit harder.

492
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:15,509
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

493
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,385
lt was a woman.

494
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:22,014
She swung an axe at me.

495

What brought you up there?

497
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,860
- Work.
- And...

498
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:38,364
you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badly

499
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,284
so you've never let yourself love again.

500
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,454
Oh, wait, that's me.

501
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:50,501
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

504
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:01,637
Your mother was a whore.

505

Drink.

506
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,523
All right.

507
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:16,027
Your father left the family when
you were very young, never to return.

508
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:17,278
Drink.

509
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,365
- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!

510
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:26,288
- [Bronn pours]
- Mm.

511
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,333
You wanted a different life.

512
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:33,170
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

513
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:35,963
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

514
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:38,132
So, specifics...

515
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,762
You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

516
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:45,641
l don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

517
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:49,436
So...what's a lowborn girl to do?

518
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,315
Drink.

519
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,903
- Are you sure...
- Drink!

520
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:08,288
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,

521
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:10,916
or l will carve your eyes from your head.

522
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,297
My dear lady,
if l have offended you, l apologise.

523
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:20,425
My turn.

524
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,635
Fine, fine.

525
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,221
Ask away.

526
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:28,016
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

527
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:31,061
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

528
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:33,521
l don't care the way the game works.

529
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,606
Our lord here used to be married.

530
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,652
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

531
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:42,114
You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

532
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,242
Another night, perhaps.

533
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:49,413
Not another night. This night.

534
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,583
lt's not a pleasant story.

535
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,128
Oh, maybe l will cry.

536
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:00,757
l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more
unpleasant stories than your lordship.

537
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,969
So...

538
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:14,061
l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding,
when we heard a scream.

539
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:18,692
She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.

540
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:23,280
Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while l wrapped her in my cloak.

541
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,199
She was too scared to send off on her own,

542
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:30,286
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
l took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

543
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:32,831
Her name was Tysha.

544
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,166
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

545
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,460
And she was hungry.

546
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:40,838
Together we finished off three chickens
and a flagon of wine.

547
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:45,135
lmpossible as it seems, there was a time
when l was unaccustomed to wine.

548
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:48,347
l forgot how afraid l was around girls...

549
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:51,849
how l was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...

550
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:53,184
look away embarrassed,

551
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:56,063
or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.

552
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,523
l forgot about everything but Tysha.

553
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,568
And somehow l found myself in her bed.

554
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:05,572
For three chickens, l should hope so.

555
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:08,742
lt didn't last long.
l didn't know what the hell l was doing.

556
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,202
But she was good to me.

557
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,288
She kissed me afterwards and...

558
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,791
San9 me a SOn9.

559
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,920
And by morning
l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

560
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,298
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

561
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,552
and there you have it - man and wife.

562
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:32,599
For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.

563
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:35,226
Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.

564
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:36,811
Not quite.

565
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,940
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

566
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,070
The girl was a whore, you see.

567
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:51,784
Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers...all of it.

568
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,371
He thought it was time l had a woman.

569
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,541
After my brother confessed...

570
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:01,711
my father brought in my wife

571
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,755
and gave her to his guards.

572
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:08,010
He paid her well -
a silver for each man.

573
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:11,012
How many whores command
that kind of price?

574
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:16,309
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

575
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:19,730
By the end, she had so much silver

576
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:24,568
that the coins were slipping through her fingers
and rolling on to the floor.

577
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:31,449
l would have killed the man
who did that to me.

578
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,536
You should have known she was a whore.

579
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:36,454
Really?

580
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,833
l was 16, drunk and in love.

581
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:45,255
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.

582
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,927
As l said, l was young and stupid.

583
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,847
You are still young and stupid.

584
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,608
[Kissing]

585
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:14,284
[Galloping hoofbeats]

586
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:20,456
Hyah!

587
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:28,590
[Horse neighs]

588
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:31,385
[Distant shouting]

589
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:36,931
[Clattering]

590
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,518
- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.

591
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:43,396
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

592
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,023
They're a mile north.

593
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:48,235
- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.

594
00:42:50,695 --> 00:42:52,572
lf l die, weep for me.

595
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,909
You will be dead.
How will you know?

596
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,168
l'll know.

597
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,922
Watch out! Move!

598
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,675
Out of the way!

599
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13,677
- Move aside!
- [Neighing]

600
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,601
Stay low.

601
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,146
Stay low?

602
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:26,606
lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.

603
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,525
l was born lucky.

604
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:34,072
Tribesmen of the Vale,

605
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:35,489
gather round!

606
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:39,619
Stone Crows!

607
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:41,914
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

608
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:44,666
- Moon Brothers!
- [Man] And Painted Dogs!

609
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,585
- And Painted Dogs!
- [Men] Painted Dogs!

610
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:50,588
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

611
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:53,509
Onward, to claim what is yours!

612
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,719
Half man! Half man!

613
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:59,181
[All] Half man! Half man!

614
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:01,849
Half man! Half man!

615
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:03,851
To battle!

616
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:05,228
[Yelling]

617
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:23,746
[Horse neighing, echoes]

618
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:26,708
[Mumled shouts]

619
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:43,182
[Wagon rumbling]

620
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,896
[Bronn] You're a shit warrior.

621
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,818
l'm alive?

622
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:55,320
You're alive.

623
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:02,327
Did we win?

624
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:05,121
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

625
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:06,998
[Screaming]

626
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:11,210
[Blades slashing]
[Men screaming]

627
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:20,554
How did our tribesmen do?

628
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:24,141
Yeah, good.

629
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:29,478
[Tyrion] It's nice to see them getting along.
[Tywin] You're wounded.

630
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:32,608
Good of you to notice.

631
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,775
l hear we won.

632
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:37,445
Huh! The scouts were wrong.

633
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,199
There were 2,OOO Stark bannermen, not 20.

634
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,411
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

635
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:45,954
He wasn't here.

636
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:48,539
Where was he?

637
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:51,001
With his other 18,OOO men.

638
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,840
And where are they?

639
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,893
- We should go, my lady.
- No!

640
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:15,650
My lady!

641
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,072
- [Neighing]
- Hyah! Hyah!

642
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:51,103
[Pants, grunts]

643
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:55,356
By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

644
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:02,822
Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword,
but l seem to have lost it.

645
00:47:02,947 --> 00:47:04,867
lt is not your sword l want.

646
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,994
Give me my daughters back.

647
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:09,954
Give me my husband.

648
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:12,541
l've lost them too, l'm afraid.

649
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:15,126
[Theon] Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

650
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:20,047
- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

651
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:23,217
[Catelyn] Take him away and put him in irons.

652
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:25,846
We could end this war right now, boy,

653
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,972
save thousands of lives.

654
00:47:28,097 --> 00:47:30,976
You fight for the Starks,
l fight for the Lannisters.

655
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:33,061
Swords or lances, teeth, nails -

656
00:47:33,186 --> 00:47:36,898
choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.

657
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,527
lf we do it your way, kingslayer...

658
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:44,322
you'd win.

659
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:48,994
We're not doing it your way.

660
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:52,748
[Greatjon] Come on, pretty man.

661
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,498
[Laughter, cheering]

662
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:06,512
- l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

663
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:09,639
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

664
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:19,358
One victory does not make us conquerors.

665
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:23,277
Did we free my father?

666
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:26,782
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

667
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:31,869
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

668
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,503
This war is far from over.

669
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:53,057
[Bell tolling]

670
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:12,411
Could l have one?

671
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:14,329
A lemon one...or any of them.

672
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,081
Three coppers.

673
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:20,543
- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.

674
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:24,463
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

675
00:49:24,547 --> 00:49:26,090
Piss off!

676
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:35,474
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

677
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,768
- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

678
00:49:37,894 --> 00:49:39,813
The Hand of the King.

679

00:50:24,775 --> 00:50:25,943
[Jeering]

682
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:49,465
- Traitor!
- Coward!

683
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:51,592
[Ned mutters] Baelor.

684
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:52,927
Baelor!

685
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:01,353
Traitor! Traitor!

686
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:13,824
[Crowd quietens]

687
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,666
l am Eddard Stark...

688
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,793
Lord of Winterfell...

689
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:28,255
and Hand of the King.

690
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:39,932
l come before you to confess my treason...

691
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:43,019
in the sight of gods and men.

692
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:46,690
l betrayed the faith of my king...

693
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:49,818
and the trust of my friend Robert.

694
00:51:51,235 --> 00:51:53,697
l swore to protect and defend his children.

695
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:56,699
But before his blood was cold...

696
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:00,494
l plotted to murder his son...

697
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:03,081
and seize the throne for myself.

698
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:04,583
[Jeering, clamouring]

699
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:19,389
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what l say...

700
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,519
Joffrey Baratheon...

701
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:27,773
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne...

702
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:31,275
by the grace of all the gods,

703
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,653
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms...

704
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:35,905
and Protector of the Realm.

705
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,157
[Crowd jeering]

706
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:38,574
[Gasps]

707
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:45,289
As... As we sin...

708
00:52:46,123 --> 00:52:47,793
so do we sumer.

709
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,963
This man has confessed his crimes...

710
00:52:51,045 --> 00:52:53,548
in sight of gods and men.

711
00:52:54,173 --> 00:52:56,802
The gods are just...

712
00:52:56,927 --> 00:53:00,389
but beloved Baelor taught us...

713
00:53:00,556 --> 00:53:02,974
they can also be merciful.

714
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:10,523
What is to be done
with this traitor, Your Grace?

715
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,275
[Jeering, catcalls]

716
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:18,489
My mother wishes me
to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

717
00:53:18,614 --> 00:53:23,954
Stripped of all titles and powers,
he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

718
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,125
And my Lady Sansa...
has begged mercy for her father.

719
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,215
But they have the soft hearts of women.

720
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,467
So long as l am your king...

721
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:41,387
treason shall never go unpunished.

722
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:43,681
Ser Ilyn...

723
00:53:44,974 --> 00:53:46,143
bring me his head!

724
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,353
- No!
- [Crowd roars]

725
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:50,313
Someone stop him!

726
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:03,577
My son, this is madness.

727
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:05,829
[Slynt] Put him down!

728
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,505
- Don't look!
- Let me go! Let me go!

729
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,175
Shut your mouth!
Look at me! Look at me!

730
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,760
Stop! Daddy! Stop!

731
00:54:20,885 --> 00:54:22,762
- No! No!
- [Crowd] Traitor!

732
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:24,181
[Sansa] Stop!

733
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:29,393
Stop him! Stop!

734
00:54:32,021 --> 00:54:33,565
[Clamouring fades]

735
00:54:33,648 --> 00:54:35,192
[Breathes slowly]

736
00:54:58,673 --> 00:55:00,092
[Wings fluttering]

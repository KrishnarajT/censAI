''Arrive within the fortnight

10
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:17,164
Poor Ned Stark.

11
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:19,749
Brave man, terrible judgment.

12
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,048
Attacking him was stupid.

13
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:33,137
[Grunts]

14
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:36,683
Lannisters...

15
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:39,268
don't act like fools.

16
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:47,319
Are you going to say something clever?

17
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:51,239
Go on, say something clever.

18
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,285
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

19
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,875
- Why is he still alive?
- Tyrion?

20
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:05,671
Ned Stark.

21
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:07,505
One of our men interfered,

22
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:10,884
speared him through the leg
before l could finish him.

23
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:14,095
Why is he still alive?

24
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:17,266
lt wouldn't have been clean.

25
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:18,809
Clean.

26
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:24,189
You spend too much time worrying
about what other people think of you.

27
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:26,315
l could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

28
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,486
That's what you want
people to think of you.

29
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,821
lt's the truth.

30
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:34,742
When you hear them whispering
''kingslayer'' behind your back,

31
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:36,826
doesn't it bother you?

32
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:41,165
Of course it bothers me.

33
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,167
A lion doesn't concern himself

34
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,251
with the opinions of the sheep.

35
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:50,423
l suppose l should be grateful
that your vanity

36
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:52,593
got in the way
of your recklessness.

37
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,847
l'm giving you half of our forces -

38
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,349
30,OOO men.

39
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:03,186
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's
girlhood home

40
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,689
and remind her that Lannisters

41
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:07,732
pay their debts.

42
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:11,987
l didn't realise you placed such
a high value on my brother's life.

43
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,530
He's a Lannister.

44
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,992
He might be the lowest of the Lannisters,
but he's one of us.

45
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:20,537
And every day that he remains a prisoner,

46
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:23,540
the less our name commands respect.

47
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:25,708
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinions of...

48
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:28,211
No, that's not an opinion. It's a fact.

49
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:33,216
lf another house
can seize one of our own

50
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,927
and hold him captive with impunity,

51
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,304
we are no longer a house to be feared.

52
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:44,894
Your mother's dead.

53
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,146
Before long l'll be dead.

54
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,066
And you...

55
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:51,360
and your brother
and your sister

56
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:52,985
and all of her children.

57
00:04:53,112 --> 00:04:57,365
All of us dead,
all of us rotting in the ground.

58
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,910
lt's the family name that lives on.

59
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:03,413
lt's all that lives on.

60
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,583
Not your personal glory,
not your honour,

61
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,544
but family.

62
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,713
Do you understand?

63
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,718
Hmm.

64
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:26,602
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

65
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:30,898
You're blessed to belong to the most
powerful family in the Kingdoms.

66
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:32,735
And you're still blessed with youth.

67
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:37,321
And what have you done
with these blessings, huh?

68
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:40,908
You've served as a glorified
bodyguard for two kings -

69
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:44,496
one a madman,
the other a drunk.

70
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:53,504
The future of our family will be determined
in these next few months.

71
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:57,676
We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.

72
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,179
Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.

73
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:07,895
l need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.

74
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:12,191
Not next year. Not tomorrow.

75
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,859
Now.

76
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:36,799
[Bell tolling]

77
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:44,847
You're in pain.

78
00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:52,898
l've had worse, my lady.

79
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:56,275
Perhaps it's time to go home.

80
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:58,194
The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.

81
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:00,780
l know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

82
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:03,783
Do you, Lord Stark?

83
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:07,371
ls that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

84
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:10,915
Has he done this before?

85
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:17,422
Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

86
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:19,133
Your brother...

87
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:20,550
or your lover?

88
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:27,975
The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years

89
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:30,602
to keep bloodlines pure.

90
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:32,771
Jaime and l are more
than brother and sister.

91
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:35,023
We shared a womb.

92
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:37,985
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

93
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:40,987
My son saw you with him.

94
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:48,953
Do you love your children?

95
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:50,956
- With all my heart.
- No more than l love mine.

96
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:54,208
- And they're all Jaime's.
- [Chuckles] Thank the gods.

97
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:57,879
ln the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

98
00:07:58,004 --> 00:07:59,797
l finish him off in other ways.

99
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,634
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

100
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,929
Hated him? l worshipped him.

101
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:10,768
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed
of him, but he was mine by oath.

102
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:14,812
And when l finally saw him
on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,

103
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:16,648
lean and fierce and black-bearded,

104
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:18,941
it was the happiest moment of my life.

105
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,862
That night he crawled on top of me,
stinking of wine,

106
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:25,823
and did what he did,
what little he could do,

107
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:30,078
and whispered in my ear, ''Lyanna.''

108
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,499
Your sister was a corpse
and l was a living girl

109
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:36,627
and he loved her more than me.

110
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:42,173
When the king returns from his hunt,
l'll tell him the truth.

111
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:45,510
You must be gone by then -
you and your children.

112
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:48,305
l will not have
their blood on my hands.

113
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,849
Go as far away as you can,

114
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:53,185
with as many men as you can.

115
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,646
Because wherever you go,

116
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:58,023
Robert's wrath will follow you.

117
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:00,859
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

118
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:03,236
You should have taken the realm for yourself.

119
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:06,197
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

120
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:09,118
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

121
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:11,577
All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.

122
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:14,331
Such a sad mistake.

123
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:16,959
l've made many mistakes in my life...

124
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,628
but that wasn't one of them.

125
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:21,296
Oh, but it was.

126
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:24,633
When you play the game of thrones,
you win.. .

127
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:26,176
or you die.

128
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:29,178
There is no middle ground.

129
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:39,313
- [Children laughing]
- Come here.

130
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:43,402
[Children crying]

131
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:48,990
[Dog barking]

132
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:55,581
[Woman moaning]

133
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:58,624
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

134
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,835
[Woman laughs and moans]

135
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:02,921
Oh!

136
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:06,925
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

137
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:11,013
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh!

138
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,682
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

139
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:16,310
Oh!

140
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:19,271
No, no, no, no!

141
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:23,691
ls that what they teach you
up in the North?

142
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:27,446
And you -
wherever you're from -

143
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:31,491
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

144
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:35,995
Either of you understand
a thing that l'm saying?

145
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:38,791
Yes, my lord.

146
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,167
Let's start over, shall we?

147
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:44,712
You be the man...

148
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:46,798
and you be the woman.

149
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,678
Well, go ahead.

150
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:57,308
Slowly.

151
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:00,645
[Soft moaning]

152
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:08,778
You're not fooling them.
They just paid you.

153
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:11,322
They know what you are.

154
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:13,533
They know it's all just an act.

155
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:16,412
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

156
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:18,621
Now, that takes time.

157
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:21,417
You need to...

158
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,460
ease into it.

159
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:27,630
Go ahead.

160
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:30,384
Ease into it.

161
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:42,980
He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.

162
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:44,898
You're starting to like this.

163
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:47,900
He wants to believe you.

164
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:51,946
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old
enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?

165
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:55,241
He knows he's better
than other men.

166
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,787
He's always known it deep down inside.
Now he has proof.

167
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:01,414
He's so good,

168
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:06,253
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there,

169
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:08,964
overcoming your very nature.

170
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:13,302
Why don't you join us, my lord?

171
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:16,930
l'm saving myself for another.

172
00:12:17,723 --> 00:12:19,557
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

173
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,685
- A stupid saying.
- [Moans]

174
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:24,812
What we don't know is usually
what gets us killed.

175
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:26,273
[Moans]

176
00:12:26,398 --> 00:12:28,316
She must be very beautiful.

177
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,111
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines though.

178
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:34,197
l do believe my lord's in love.

179
00:12:34,281 --> 00:12:37,701
For many years.
Most of my life, really.

180
00:12:37,743 --> 00:12:39,036
Play with her arse.

181
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,287
And she loved me too.

182
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,834
l was her little confidant, her plaything.

183
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,921
She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

184
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:52,883
She told me about all the horses
that she liked,

185
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:55,302
the castle that she wanted to live in

186
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:58,305
and the man that she wanted to marry -

187
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:01,682
a Northerner...
with a jaw like an anvil.

188
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,936
- [Moaning]
- So l challenged him to a duel.

189
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:07,855
l mean, why not?
l'd read all the stories.

190
00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:11,652
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

191
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:16,197
ln the end,
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

192
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:18,741
''He's just a boy,'' she said.

193
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:20,786
''Please don't hurt him.''

194
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:25,624
So he gave me a nice little scar
to remember him by, and off they went.

195
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,459
ls she still married to him?

196
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,504
Oh, no. He got himself killed
before the wedding...

197
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:32,505
[Gasping loudly]

198
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,384
..and she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive specimen.

199
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:39,095
She loves him, l'm afraid.

200
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:42,765
And why wouldn't she?
l mean, who could compare to him?

201
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,101
- He's just so...
- [Shrieks and moans]

202
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:46,979
[Moaning]
[Laughs]

203
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:50,691
[Moaning, sighing]

204
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:52,609
..good.

205
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:57,614
Do you know what l learned,
Iosing that duel?

206
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:01,951
l learned that l'll never win, not that way.

207
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:03,954
That's their game,

208
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:06,623
their rules.

209
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:08,709
l'm not going to fight them.

210
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:12,004
l'm going to fuck them.
That's what l know.

211
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:14,255
That's what l am.

212
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,216
And only by admitting what we are
can we get what we want.

213
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:20,637
And what do you want?

214
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,307
Oh, everything, my dear.

215
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:26,268
Everything there is.

216
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,273
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.

217
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,323
Hmm.

218
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:56,297
[Footsteps]

219
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:05,807
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

220
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:12,605
Where l come from,
we don't show mercy to criminals.

221
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,402
Where l come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord...

222
00:15:16,527 --> 00:15:19,779
at low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,

223
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:22,783
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

224
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:25,411
The sea would come in
closer and closer.

225
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:29,123
You'd see death creeping towards you
a few inches at a time.

226
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,252
Where is it you come from?

227
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:35,461
The Iron Islands.

228
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:36,629
They far away?

229
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:39,133
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

230
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:42,885
Trust me, you've never heard
where l'm from neither.

231
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,348
''Trust me, my lord.''

232
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:51,478
You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

233
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:53,855
ln civilised lands,
you refer to your betters

234
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,066
by their proper titles.

235
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,819
- And what's that?
- Lord.

236
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:00,778
Why?

237
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,532
Why?

238
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:05,576
What do you mean, why?

239
00:16:05,658 --> 00:16:08,912
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

240
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:10,621
What's that got to do with you?

241
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,584
lf your father's lord,

242
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,585
how can you be lord too?

243
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:20,173
- l will be lord after my father.
- So you're not lord now?

244
00:16:20,257 --> 00:16:22,134
No, you...

245
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,013
Are you having a go at me?
Is that it?

246
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:29,932
l just don't understand
how you southerners do things.

247
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:33,311
- l'm not a southerner.
- You're from south of the Wall.

248
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:36,481
That makes you a southerner to me.

249
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:41,445
You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

250
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,322
Couldn't say, my lord.

251
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,366
Don't know what ''impunent'' means.

252
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,369
lmpudent.

253
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:51,830
lt means rude, disrespectful.

254
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,128
Do you want to lose that chain?

255
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:02,508
Theon Greyjoy!

256
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,052
The lady is our guest.

257
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:07,053
l thought she was our prisoner.

258
00:17:07,137 --> 00:17:10,808
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

259
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:24,237
Chances are l won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

260
00:17:24,362 --> 00:17:26,115
l'm used to worse than him.

261
00:17:26,197 --> 00:17:27,241
Hmm?

262
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:30,077
l'm used to men who could
chew that boy up

263
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:32,620
and pick their teeth with his bones.

264
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:34,289
[Chuckles]

265
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:40,212
Why did you come here?

266
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,296
Didn't mean to come here.

267
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:45,300
Meant to get much further south than this.

268
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:48,302
As far south as south goes,

269
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:50,513
before the long night comes.

270
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:54,435
Why? What are you afraid of?

271
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,604
There's things that sleep in the day
and hunt at night.

272
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:03,318
- Owls and shadowcats...
- l'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.

273
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:09,908
The things you speak of -

274
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:13,536
they've been gone
for thousands of years.

275
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:15,496
They wasn't gone, old man.

276
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,375
They was sleeping.

277
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:22,004
And they ain't sleeping no more.

278
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:33,639
[Samwell] l miss girls.

279
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:36,476
Not even talking to them.
l never talked to them.

280
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:40,063
Just looking at them,

281
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:41,732
hearing them giggle.

282
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:49,447
Don't you miss girls?

283
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:55,704
Riders.

284
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:59,166
The horn.
We have to blow the horn.

285
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:02,461
Why is he alone?

286
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,840
One blast for a ranger returning,

287
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:08,716
two for wildlings,

288
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:10,968
- three for...
- There's no rider.

289
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:19,645
[Creaking]

290
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:24,483
[Neighs, snorts]

291
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:41,917
[Neighs]

292
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:45,212
- [Neighs]
- Whoa, boy, whoa.

293
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,423
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.

294
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,883
[Neighing continues]

295
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:57,558
Where's my uncle?

296
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:02,271
Ned!

297
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:07,067
lt's Robert.
We were hunting...

298
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:08,944
a boar...

299
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:19,288
[Robert] l should have
spent more time with you,

300
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,123
shown you how to be a man.

301
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:27,963
l was never meant to be a father.

302
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,360
Go on.

303
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:52,571
You don't want to see this.

304
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:08,795
My fault.

305
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:12,256
Too much wine,
missed my thrust.

306
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,769
[Robert] It stinks.

307
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:27,063
lt stinks like death.

308
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:29,983
Don't think l can't smell it.

309
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:31,193
[Robert laughs]

310
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:35,446
l paid the bastard back, Ned.

311
00:21:36,156 --> 00:21:38,867
l drove my knife
right through his brain.

312
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:41,411
You ask 'em if l didn't. Ask 'em!

313
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:47,458
l want the funeral feast to be
the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.

314
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:52,130
And l want everyone
to taste the boar that got me.

315
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:59,096
Now leave us, the lot of you.
l need to talk to Ned.

316
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:02,349
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out, all of you!

317
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:04,642
[Coughing]

318
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,039
You damned fool.

319
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,331
Paper and ink on the table.

320
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:29,709
Write down what l say.

321
00:22:37,008 --> 00:22:41,346
''ln the name of Robert

You know how it goes.

324
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,935
Fill in the damn titles.

325
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:49,103
''l hereby command

Give it over.

At least they'll say l did this right,

this one thing.

337
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:53,334
You'll rule now.

No one to tell me ''no'' but you.

Only you.

Let her live.

356
00:24:56,648 --> 00:24:58,817
murdered by a pig.

357

[Wheezes, coughs]

358
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:06,033
Give me something for the pain
and let me die.

359
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,882
Give him milk of the poppy.

360
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:32,935
He was reeling from the wine.

361
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,645
[Door closes]

362
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:36,729
He commanded us to...

363
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:38,148
step aside, but...

364
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:41,401
l failed him.

365
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:46,407
No man could have
protected him from himself.

366
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:50,244
l wonder, Ser Barristan,

367
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:53,162
who gave the king this wine?

368
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:57,292
His squire,
from the king's own skin.

369
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:00,044
His squire? The Lannister boy?

370
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:03,298
Such a dutiful boy
to make sure His Grace

371
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:05,842
did not lack refreshment.

372
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:09,429
l do hope the poor lad
does not blame himself.

373
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:21,149
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

374
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:25,987
Whatever arrangements you made...

375
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:29,533
unmake them. At once.

376
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:32,953
l'm afraid those birds have flown.

377
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,122

My brother was a fool, l know,

405

Have l said something funny, ser?

408

Forgive me, Khaleesi,
but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror

409
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,662
didn't seize six of the Kingdoms
because they were his right.

410
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:42,623
He had no right to them.
He seized them because he could.

411

l'm afraid l am not worthy of the vintage.

467
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:14,378

who would drink up his own wares.

lt's the steward's life for me.

498
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,363
There's honour in being a steward.

499
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:07,865
Not much, really.

500
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,450
But there's food.

00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:24,943
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your uncle did.

521
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:26,111
Yes, my lord.

522
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:29,113
You'll find a weirwood
a mile north of the Wall.

523
00:35:29,238 --> 00:35:32,033
And your old gods too, maybe.

524
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,120
My lord, might l go as well?

525
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:38,082
Does House Tarly keep the old gods?

526
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:40,501
No, my lord.

527
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:43,169
l was named in the light of the Seven,

528
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:45,798
as my father was
and his father before him.

529
00:35:45,881 --> 00:35:49,802
Why would you forsake the gods
of your father and your House?

530
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:54,055
The Night's Watch is my House now.

531
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:56,682
The Seven have never answered my prayers.

532
00:35:57,934 --> 00:36:00,104
Perhaps the old gods will.

533
00:36:01,437 --> 00:36:02,939
As you wish, lad.

534
00:36:03,981 --> 00:36:06,901
You've all been assigned an order,

535
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,821
according to our needs

536
00:36:09,905 --> 00:36:11,615
and your strengths.

537
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:14,575
Halder to the builders.

538
00:36:15,577 --> 00:36:17,329
Pyp to the stewards.

539
00:36:17,454 --> 00:36:20,289
Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.

540
00:36:20,374 --> 00:36:22,334
Samwell to the stewards.

541
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:26,003
Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.

542
00:36:26,088 --> 00:36:28,090
Balian to the rangers.

543
00:36:28,131 --> 00:36:29,716
Rast to the rangers.

544
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,427
Jon to the stewards.

545
00:36:31,552 --> 00:36:33,262
Rancer to the builder.

546
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:36,265
Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards.

547
00:36:36,347 --> 00:36:39,727
Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.

548
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:42,854
Vorkoy to the builders.
Joby to the stables.

549
00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:46,191
Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.

550
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:48,610
Nelugo to the rangers.

551
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:52,238
May all the gods preserve you.

552
00:36:56,994 --> 00:36:59,537
Rangers with me.

553
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:02,166
Builders!

554
00:37:21,184 --> 00:37:25,731
Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.

555
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:29,776
Pyp, you will report
to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

556
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:34,573
Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe
in the stables.

557
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:38,535
Dareon, we are sending you
to Eastwatch.

558
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:41,454
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

559
00:37:41,497 --> 00:37:44,707
Make no comment about his nose.

560
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:48,961
Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Mormont

561
00:37:49,128 --> 00:37:52,048
has requested you
for his personal steward.

562
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:56,762
Will l serve the Lord Commander's meals
and fetch hot water for his bath?

563
00:37:56,928 --> 00:38:00,640
Certainly. And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,

564
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:03,559
change his sheets
and blankets daily

565
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:07,356
and do everything else
the Lord Commander requires of you.

566
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:11,901
Do you take me for a servant?

567
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:14,613
We took you for a man
of the Night's Watch.

568
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:17,532
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

569
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:21,202
- May l go?
- As you wish.

570
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:30,963
Jon, wait! Don't you see
what they're doing?

571
00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:32,965
l see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

572
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,841
He wanted it and he got it.

573
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,428
Stewards are nothing but maids!

574
00:38:37,553 --> 00:38:39,555
l'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of you!

575
00:38:39,722 --> 00:38:42,682
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

576
00:38:43,474 --> 00:38:45,769
l was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall

577
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:48,814
when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

578
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:52,735
l pushed him away and he said he'd have
my hands cut off for stealing their silver.

579
00:38:52,818 --> 00:38:54,653
So now l'm here -
at the end of the world

580
00:38:54,778 --> 00:38:57,530
with no one to sing for
but old men and little shits like you.

581
00:38:57,613 --> 00:38:59,532
l'll never see my family again.

582
00:38:59,657 --> 00:39:01,744
l'll never be inside a woman again.

583
00:39:01,827 --> 00:39:02,995
So don't tell me about fair.

584
00:39:03,162 --> 00:39:06,914
l thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.

585
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:11,128
Think l was gonna tell a bunch of strangers
that a high lord tried to grab my cock?

586
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:17,258
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
l'd like to hear a song.

587
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:24,057
Now listen to me.

588
00:39:24,182 --> 00:39:27,436
The old man is the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

589
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:29,354
You'll be with him day and night.

590
00:39:29,437 --> 00:39:31,939
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

591
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:35,861
But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,

592
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:37,863
squire for him in battle.

593
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:41,575
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

594
00:39:41,742 --> 00:39:43,285
And he asked for you himself.

595
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:47,122
He wants to groom you for command.

596
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:53,878
l just...

597
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:56,923
l always wanted to be a ranger.

598
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:01,178
l always wanted to be a wizard.

599
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,557
- [Laughs]
- What?

600
00:40:06,432 --> 00:40:07,892
No, l'm serious.

601
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:10,562
So you'll stay
and say your words with me?

602
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:20,405
Lord Stark...a moment.

603
00:40:21,573 --> 00:40:23,617
Alone, if you will.

604
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:35,253
He named you Protector of the Realm.

605
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:38,506
He did.

606
00:40:38,631 --> 00:40:40,258
She won't care.

607
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:43,803
Give me an hour and l can put
a hundred swords at your command.

608
00:40:43,928 --> 00:40:45,680
And what should l do
with a hundred swords?

609
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:49,642
Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

610
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:53,187
We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.

611
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:57,108
Protector of the Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

612
00:40:58,068 --> 00:41:01,280
Every moment you delay gives Cersei
another moment to prepare.

613
00:41:01,363 --> 00:41:04,282
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

614
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:06,160
What about Stannis?

615
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:09,495
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering them to Stannis?

616
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:12,291
You have odd notions
about protecting the realm.

617
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:14,042
Stannis is your older brother.

618
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,294
This isn't about the bloody
line of succession.

619
00:41:16,378 --> 00:41:20,506
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.

620
00:41:22,468 --> 00:41:24,595
What's best for the Kingdoms?

621
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:27,597
What's best for the people we rule?

622
00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:31,267
We all know what Stannis is.

623
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,646
He inspires no love or loyalty.

624
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:36,439
He's not a king.

625
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:39,151
l am.

626
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,742
Stannis is a commander.

627
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:50,995
He's led men into war twice.

628
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,831
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.

629
00:41:52,956 --> 00:41:55,751
Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that. So was Robert.

630
00:41:57,086 --> 00:41:58,169
Tell me something.

631
00:41:58,294 --> 00:42:00,671
Do you still believe good soldiers
make good kings?

632
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,140
l will not dishonour Robert's last hours
by shedding blood in his halls...

633
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:13,684
and dragging frightened children
from their beds.

634
00:42:27,323 --> 00:42:29,992
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

635
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,745
You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.

636
00:42:34,497 --> 00:42:36,207
Not his steward...

637
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,628
not his captain of the guard...

638
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:42,004
and not his wife.

639
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,720
Only Stannis himself.

640
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:51,724
- [Knocking]
- Yes, my lord.

641
00:42:54,184 --> 00:42:55,436
Now leave us.

642
00:43:04,861 --> 00:43:07,238
My Lord Protector.

643
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,829
The king has no trueborn sons.

644
00:43:15,872 --> 00:43:17,416
Joffrey and Tommen...

645
00:43:17,582 --> 00:43:19,459
are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

646
00:43:20,669 --> 00:43:24,965
- So when the king dies...
- The throne passes to his brother...

647
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:27,885
Lord Stannis.

648
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:30,220
So it would seem.

649
00:43:32,055 --> 00:43:34,307
- Unless...
- There is no ''unless''.

650
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:36,727
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

651
00:43:36,894 --> 00:43:38,937
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

652
00:43:39,062 --> 00:43:43,066
You would be wise to deny it to him
and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

653
00:43:46,028 --> 00:43:48,738
Do you have a shred of honour?

654
00:43:48,905 --> 00:43:52,658
You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.

655
00:43:52,742 --> 00:43:54,952
All of the power is yours.
You need only...

656
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,581
reach out and take it.

657
00:43:57,747 --> 00:43:59,791
Make peace with the Lannisters.

658
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:03,336
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

659
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:06,173
We've plenty of time to get rid of Stannis,

660
00:44:06,298 --> 00:44:09,718
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he comes into his throne,

661
00:44:09,843 --> 00:44:12,095
we simply reveal his little secret

662
00:44:12,178 --> 00:44:15,307
- and seat Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

663
00:44:15,474 --> 00:44:19,227
You'll need someone to share these burdens,
l assure you.

664
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:21,396
My price would be modest.

665
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:24,524
What you suggest is treason.

666
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:26,735
Only if we lose.

667
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:32,073
Make peace with the Lannisters,
you say.. .

668
00:44:33,575 --> 00:44:35,660
with the people who tried to murder my boy.

669
00:44:35,827 --> 00:44:39,247
We only make peace
with our enemies, my lord.

670
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:41,582
That's why it's called ''making peace''.

671
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:44,919
No. l won't do it.

672
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:47,548
So it will be Stannis and war?

673
00:44:47,588 --> 00:44:49,841
There is no other choice.

674
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:52,302
He is the heir.

675
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:54,887
So why did you call me here?

676
00:44:55,055 --> 00:44:57,099
Not for my wisdom, clearly.

677
00:44:58,725 --> 00:45:00,811
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

678
00:45:00,936 --> 00:45:03,731
The queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms -

679
00:45:03,814 --> 00:45:07,693
enough to overwhelm what remains
of my household guard.

680
00:45:07,776 --> 00:45:09,611
l need the gold cloaks.

681
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:12,905
The City Watch is 2,OOO strong...

682
00:45:13,698 --> 00:45:16,160
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

683
00:45:18,912 --> 00:45:20,622
Look at you.

684
00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:23,791
You know what you want me to do,

685
00:45:23,876 --> 00:45:25,919
you know it has to be done,

686
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:28,129
but it's not honourable, so...

687
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:30,631
the words stick in your throat.

688
00:45:31,383 --> 00:45:33,760
When the queen proclaims one king

689
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:35,595
and the Hand proclaims another,

690
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,390
whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?

691
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:41,977
Who do they follow?

692
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:48,901

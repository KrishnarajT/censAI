1
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:15,738
Welcome, Lord Stark.

2
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:18,951
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

3
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:21,035
The honour of your presence is requested.

4
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:25,707
Get the girls settled in.
l'll be back in time for supper.

5
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:28,417
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my lord.

6
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:32,046
lf you'd like to change into something
more appropriate...

7
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,601
[Doors creaking]

8
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:10,586
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

9
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:14,797
About time we had
some stern northern leadership.

10
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:17,718
Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

11
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,803
Sturdy old thing.

12
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:22,263
How many kings' arses
have polished it, l wonder?

13
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,141
Um, what's the line?

14
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:27,518
The king shits and the Hand wipes.

15
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,855
Very handsome armour.

16
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:33,357
- Not a scratch on it.
- l know.

17
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:37,029
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

18
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:39,822
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

19
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:43,075
l have a knack for it.

20
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:49,332
lt must be strange for you,
coming into this room.

21
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:54,587
l was standing right here
when it happened.

22
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:57,673
He was very brave, your brother.

23
00:03:57,757 --> 00:03:59,593
Your father, too.

24
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:01,719
They didn't deserve to die like that.

25
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:04,640
Nobody deserves to die like that.

26
00:04:04,723 --> 00:04:06,600
But you just stood there and watched.

27
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:09,645
500 men just stood there and watched.

28
00:04:10,437 --> 00:04:12,397
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.

29
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:14,857
You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?

30
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:17,486
No, Lord Stark.

31
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:21,697
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

32
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,954
Except for the screams, of course,

33
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,039
and the Mad King laughing.

34
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:30,748
And later...

35
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,419
when l watched the Mad King die,

36
00:04:34,503 --> 00:04:37,839
l remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

37
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:40,842
lt felt like justice.

38
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:46,472
ls that what you tell yourself at night?

39
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,394
You're a servant ofjustice?

40
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,981
That you were avenging my father when you
shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

41
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:59,861
Tell me, if l'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly
instead of the back,

42
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,738
would you admire me more?

43
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:06,909
You served him well...
when serving was safe.

44
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:22,092
Lord Stark.

45
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:26,012
Lord Varys.

46
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:29,849
l was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles
on the Kingsroad.

47
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:33,604
We are all praying
for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

48
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:36,940
A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.

49
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:41,361
Renly! You're looking well.

50
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:43,154
And you look tired from the road.

51
00:05:43,238 --> 00:05:45,490
l told them this meeting could wait
another day, but...

52
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:48,284
[Man] But we have a kingdom
to look after.

53
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:51,495
l've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

54
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,082
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

55
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,212
l understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

56
00:05:58,294 --> 00:06:01,505
All too well.
l still carry a token of his esteem...

57
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,507
from navel to collarbone.

58
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05,676
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

59
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,596
lt wasn't the man that l chose, my lord.

60
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:10,015
lt was Catelyn Tully.

61
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:13,351
A woman worth fighting for,
l'm sure you'll agree.

62
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:16,063
l humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.

63
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:18,690
Grand Maester.

64
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:21,068
How many years has it been?

65
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:24,654
- You were a young man.
- And you served another king.

66
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:29,200
Oh, how forgetful of me.

67
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:33,038
This belongs to you now.

68
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:37,500
Should we begin?

69
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:40,546
- Without the king?
- Winter may be coming,

70
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:43,923
but l'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

71
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:46,092
[Varys] His Grace has many cares.

72
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:50,846
He entrusts some small matters to us
that we might lighten the load.

73
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:53,767
We are the lords of small matters here.

74
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:01,733
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

75
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,236
in honour of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

76
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:07,906
- Mm, how much?
- 40,OOO gold dragons to the champion,

77
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,575
20,OOO to the runner-up,

78
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:12,743
20,OOO to the winning archer.

79
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,163
Can the treasury bear such expense?

80
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:18,125
l'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters
will accommodate, l expect.

81
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:21,419
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,OOO?

82
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:23,296
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

83
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:27,258
- l'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
- How could you let this happen?

84
00:07:27,342 --> 00:07:31,512
The master of coin finds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.

85
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:35,142
l will not believe Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

86
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:38,060
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,

87
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:41,899
but l fear His Grace doesn't always listen.

88
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:44,483
''Counting coppers,'' he calls it.

89
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:47,404
l'll speak to him tomorrow.

90
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,740
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot amord.

91
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:52,284
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

92
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:55,286
There will be no plans...
until l speak to Robert.

93
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,335
Forgive me, my lords. l'm...

94
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:06,839
- l had a long ride.
- You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

95
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:09,426
We serve at your pleasure.

96
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,517
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

97
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:24,483
- It's ugly.
- A king should have scars.

98
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:28,320
You fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

99
00:08:28,445 --> 00:08:32,115
l'm not like him. l didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all l did was scream.

100
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:34,867
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.

101
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:37,995
That's not true. You killed the beast.

102
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:41,290
You only spared the girl because of the love
your father bears her father.

103
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:42,750
l didn't, l...

104
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:47,548
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne,
your father was a rebel and a traitor.

105
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,217
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

106
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:56,765
Do l have to marry her?

107
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,726
Yes.

108
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,978
She's very beautiful and young.

109
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:05,356
lf you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions

110
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:09,819
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

111
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:14,866
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.

112
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:17,494
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins,
so be it.

113
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:21,789
You are my darling boy and the world
will be exactly as you want it to be.

114
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:27,712
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

115
00:09:27,795 --> 00:09:29,630
- l don't want to.
- No, but you will.

116
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:34,595
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

117
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:37,179
We allow the northerners too much power.

118
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:39,725
They consider themselves our equals.

119
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,351
How would you handle them?

120
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:47,149
l'd double their taxes and command them
to supply 10,OOO men to the royal army.

121
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:48,482
A royal army?

122
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,401
Why should every lord
command his own men?

123
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:52,696
lt's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.

124
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,866
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

125
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:57,659
trained by experienced soldiers,

126
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:01,370
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

127
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:03,832
And if the northerners rebel?

128
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:05,542
l'd crush them.

129
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:09,755
Seize Winterfell and install someone
Ioyal to the realm as warden of the North.

130
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,255
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

131
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,052
And these 10,OOO northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

132
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:17,346
- For me. l'm their king.
- Mm-hm.

133
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:19,431
But you've just invaded their homeland,

134
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:22,266
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- l'm not asking.

135
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,270
The North cannot be held,
not by an outsider.

136
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:27,438
lt's too big and too wild.

137
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:29,106
And when the winter comes,
the seven gods together

138
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:31,360
couldn't save you and your royal army.

139
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:34,321
A good king knows
when to save his strength...

140
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:38,324
and when to destroy his enemies.

141
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:41,035
So you agree...

142
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:43,413
the Starks are enemies?

143
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:49,252
Everyone who isn't us...
is an enemy.

144
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:55,008
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

145
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:57,093
- l'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

146
00:10:57,177 --> 00:10:59,136
- The prince.
- Arya, stop!

147
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:02,390
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

148
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:03,808
The Hound killed your friend.

149
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:06,352
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

150
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:08,813
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth,

151
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:10,106
Mycah would be alive.

152
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:11,607
Enough!

153
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:15,904
What's happening here?

154
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,240
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

155
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:22,285
Go to your room. We'll speak later.

156
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,837
That's for you, love.

157
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:45,016
The same dollmaker
makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

158
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:48,477
Don't you like it?

159
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:52,149
l haven't played with dolls since l was eight.

160
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:56,694
- May l be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

161
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,947
lt's all right. Go on.

162
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:11,250
War was easier than daughters.

163
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,383
- [Knock on door]
- Go away!

164
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:20,968
[Ned] Arya, open the door.

165
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:33,189
May l come in?

166
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:42,406
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

167
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:44,201
Give it to me.

168
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:53,751
l know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

169
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:57,713
Where did you get this?

170
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:03,886
This is no toy.

171
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,725
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- l wasn't playing.

172
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:10,769
And l don't want to be a lady.

173
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:13,105
Come here.

174
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:20,654
Now what do you want with this?

175
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,115
lt's called Needle.

176
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,284
Oh, a blade with a name.

177
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:28,953
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

178
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,039
Your sister?

179
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:33,417
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

180
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:35,294
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

181
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:38,212
[Laughs] That's the essence of it.

182
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:43,217
l was trying to learn.

183
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:47,722
l asked Mycah to practice with me.

184
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,312
l asked him. It was my fault.

185
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:58,608
No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.

186
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:03,154
l hate them. l hate all of them.

187
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,531
The Hound, the queen and the king

188
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:07,201
and Joffrey and Sansa.

189
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:09,952
Sansa was dragged
before the king and queen...

190
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:13,582
and asked to call the prince a liar.

191
00:14:13,624 --> 00:14:16,210
So was l! He is a liar.

192
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:18,337
Shh, darling, listen to me.

193
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:22,466
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey someday.

194
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:25,218
She cannot betray him.

195
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,971
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

196
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:31,933
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

197
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:35,729
Well...

198
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:39,857
Look at me.

199
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:43,111
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

200
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,740
Winter is coming.

201
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:51,912
You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.

202
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:54,372
But now winter is truly coming.

203
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:58,460
And in the winter
we must protect ourselves,

204
00:14:58,544 --> 00:14:59,919
look after one another.

205
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:02,338
Sansa is your sister.

206
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:05,800
l don't hate her.

207
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,843
Not really.

208
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:13,015
l don't want to frighten you,
but l won't lie to you either.

209
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,561
We've come to a dangerous place.

210
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:19,021
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.

211
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:22,024
All right?

212
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:25,361
Go on. It's yours.

213
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:30,534
l can keep it?

214
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:33,578
Try not to stab your sister with it.

215
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:35,289
[Chuckles]

216
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:46,466
lf you're going to own a sword,
you'd better know how to use it.

217
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:49,010
[Door opens, closes]

218
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:51,679
[Cawing]

219
00:15:54,223 --> 00:15:57,977
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.

220
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:04,109
- l know a story about a crow.
- l hate your stories.

221
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:07,321
l know a story about a boy who hated stories.

222
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:11,033
l could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.

223
00:16:11,116 --> 00:16:13,034
Those were always your favourites.

224
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:15,412
Those weren't my favourites.

225
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:18,039
My favourites were the scary ones.

226
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:23,629
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

227
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:26,965
I
Fear is for the winter

228
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:30,302
when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.

229
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:34,847
Fear is for the long night,
when the sun hides for years

230
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:39,937
and children are born and live and die,
all in darkness.

231
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:43,689
That is the time for fear, my little lord,

232
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:46,985
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

233
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:53,699
Thousands of years ago there came a night
that lasted a generation.

234
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:56,662
Kings froze to death in their castles,

235
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:58,914
same as the shepherds in their huts.

236
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:03,751
And women smothered their babies
rather than see them starve,

237
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:08,173
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

238
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:11,801
So is this the sort of story that you like?

239
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:19,559
ln that darkness, the white walkers
came for the first time.

240
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:22,687
They swept through cities and kingdoms,

241
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:24,897
riding their dead horses,

242
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:28,818
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as hounds...

243
00:17:28,943 --> 00:17:31,113
[Door rattles]

244
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,200
What are you telling him now?

245
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:37,618
Only what the little lord wants to hear.

246
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:40,329
Get your supper. l want some time with him.

247
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:53,260
- [Door closes]
- One time she told me

248
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:55,554
the sky is blue
because we live inside the eye

249
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:58,432
of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.

250
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:00,600
Maybe we do.

251
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:05,146
How do you feel?

252
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:10,860
You still don't remember anything?

253
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:17,033
Bran, l've seen you climb
a thousand times.

254
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:18,952
ln the wind, in the rain...

255
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:21,121
A thousand times.

256
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:23,456
- You never fall.
- l did though.

257
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,712
lt's true, isn't it,

258
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:32,089
what Maester Luwin says about my legs?

259
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:41,516
l'd rather be dead.

260
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:46,062
- Don't ever say that.
- l'd rather be dead.

261
00:18:57,782 --> 00:19:00,285
Fewer eyes back here, my lady.

262
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:02,496
But still too many.

263
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:05,164
lt's nine years since l've set foot
in the capital.

264
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:08,501
And no one knew who l was
the last time l came, either.

265
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:14,590
My lady.

266
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,844
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

267
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,762
l would. We've done nothing wrong.

268
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:22,057
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

269
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:23,892
lnstructed?

270
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:26,603
l don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...

271
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:28,396
Follow me, Lady Stark.

272
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:40,533
Cat!

273
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:43,912
Go on. Go upstairs.

274
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:48,791
You little worm!

275
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:53,129
You take me for some back-alley Sally
you can drag into a...

276
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:56,592
Pssst!

277
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,097
l meant no disrespect,
to you of all people.

278
00:20:03,264 --> 00:20:07,227
How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?

279
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:09,812
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

280
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,442
l'm truly sorry...about the locale.

281
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:15,818
How did you know l was
coming to King's Landing?

282
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:18,864
A dear friend told me.

283
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:23,452
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

284
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:27,539
To see you again after so many years
is a blessing.

285
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:28,999
Your poor hands.

286
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,086
How did you know l was coming?

287
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:35,588
Knowledge is my trade, my lady.

288
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:39,885
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?

289
00:20:41,552 --> 00:20:43,846
My little birds are everywhere...

290
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:46,098
even in the North.

291
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:49,685
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

292
00:20:55,107 --> 00:20:57,068
Valyrian steel.

293
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,946
Do you know whose dagger this is?

294
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:03,658
l must admit l do not.

295
00:21:04,826 --> 00:21:07,246
Well, well, this is an historic day.

296
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:11,583
Something you don't know that l do.

297
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:17,798
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

298
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:21,843
- It's mine.
- Yours?

299
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,222
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

300
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,225
l bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,

301
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,103
as any sane man would.

302
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:36,191
When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him,
l lost this dagger.

303
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,443
To whom?

304
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:40,444
Tyrion Lannister.

305
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,780
The Imp.

306
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:45,491
[Man] Grenn, show him
what you farm boys are made of.

307
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,618
[Grunting]

308
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:53,750
lf that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

309
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:59,506
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle
spitting down on the likes of you.

310
00:22:00,173 --> 00:22:01,549
Pyp.

311
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:05,636
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard
bleeds like the rest of us?

312
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:11,058
[Shouts]

313
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:13,645
[Coughs]

314
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:15,606
Next!

315
00:22:23,238 --> 00:22:24,239
[Grunting]

316
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:27,783
Next!

317
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,168
[Grunting]

318
00:22:40,797 --> 00:22:45,135
Well, Lord Snow, it appears
you're the least useless person here.

319
00:22:46,177 --> 00:22:47,386
Go clean yourselves up!

320
00:22:47,511 --> 00:22:50,264
There's only so much
l can stomach in a day.

321
00:22:50,348 --> 00:22:52,768
A charming man.

322
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:55,354
l don't need him to be charming.

323
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,523
l need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

324
00:22:58,648 --> 00:23:00,067
into men of the Night's Watch.

325
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:03,529
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

326
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:05,154
Slowly.

327
00:23:07,491 --> 00:23:10,702
A raven came...for Ned Stark's son.

328
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,084
Good news or bad?

329
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:18,793
Both.

330
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,382
[Maester Pycelle] Lord Stark.

331
00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:26,300
[Wheezing] l meant...
to give you this earlier.

332
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,596
So forgetful these days.

333
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:35,227
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

334
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:48,155
Good news?

335
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:54,121
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.

336
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:59,250
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

337
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:09,595
[Woman] Yes, l'm looking at you.

338
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,387
[Laughter]

339
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:14,933
l thought that she'd be safest in here.

340
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:17,810
One of several such
establishments l own.

341
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:21,647
You're a funny man.

342
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:24,151
Huh? A very funny man.

343
00:24:25,943 --> 00:24:27,654
Ned!

344
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:36,163
Ah, the Starks...

345
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:39,124
Quick tempers, slow minds.

346
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:46,839
You broke my nose, bastard!

347
00:24:55,014 --> 00:24:56,224
lt's an improvement.

348
00:24:59,435 --> 00:25:02,314
lf we threw you over the Wall,
l wonder how long it would take you to hit.

349
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:04,691
l wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

350
00:25:04,732 --> 00:25:06,108
[Door opens]

351
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:11,490
What are you looking at, halfman?

352
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:14,158
l'm looking at you.

353
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:19,414
Yes. You've got an interesting face.

354
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:23,585
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

355
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:25,295
All of you.

356
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,548
And what do you care about our faces?

357
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:29,423
lt's just...

358
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:33,511
l think they would look marvellous
decorating spikes in King's Landing.

359
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:36,557
Perhaps l'll write to my sister,
the queen, about it.

360
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:41,144
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

361
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:51,404
Everybody knew what this place was
and no one told me.

362
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:52,865
No one but you.

363
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,536
My father knew and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

364
00:25:57,618 --> 00:25:59,746
Grenn's father left him too...

365
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:03,000
outside a farmhouse, when he was three.

366
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:07,087
Pyp was caught stealing
a wheel of cheese.

367
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:10,464
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.

368
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,260
He was given a choice -
his right hand or the Wall.

369
00:26:14,385 --> 00:26:18,264
l've been asking the Lord Commander
about them. Fascinating stories.

370
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:20,267
They hate me because
l'm better than they are.

371
00:26:20,392 --> 00:26:24,770
lt's a lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.

372
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,356
l don't imagine any of them
had ever held a real sword

373
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:29,483
before they came here.

374
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:34,740
Oh...

375
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:36,908
Your brother Bran.

376
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,077
He's woken up.

377
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:44,458
The mere suggestion that the queen's brother
tried to kill your boy

378
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,791
would be considered treason.

379
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,127
We have proof. We have the blade.

380
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,254
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

381
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:52,840
The only man who could say otherwise
has no throat,

382
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:54,218
thanks to your boy's wolf.

383
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:58,096
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

384
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:03,559
He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.

385
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:06,145
l'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.

386
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,981
A fool's task, admittedly,

387
00:27:08,106 --> 00:27:10,651
but l've never been able
to refuse your wife anything.

388
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:12,818
l won't forget this.

389
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:14,988
You're a true friend.

390
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:18,241
Don't tell anyone.

- Calm down.

393
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,791
He's a child. Ten years old.

394
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,252
- What were you thinking?
- l was thinking of us.

395
00:27:29,336 --> 00:27:31,837
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

396
00:27:31,922 --> 00:27:35,759
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing. He remembers nothing.

397
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:37,927
Then what are you raving about?

398
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,472
What if it comes back to him?
If he tells his father what he saw...

399
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:43,849
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

400
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:47,812
We'll say whatever we like.
l think we can outfox a ten-year-old.

401
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:51,023
- And my husband?
- l'll go to war with him if l have to.

402
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:53,777

''The War For Cersei's Cunt.''

- Let me go.
- Never.

406
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:06,999
- Let me go.
- The boy won't talk.

407
00:28:07,915 --> 00:28:10,085
And if he does, l'll kill him.

the whole bloody lot of them,

409

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:34,443
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

412
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:36,694
Until we know who our enemies are.

413
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:38,905

The Lannisters.

ln my bones, l know it.

00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:42,910
Littlefinger's right.

416

l can't do anything without proof.

Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

440
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:49,994
My horse took an arrow so l was on foot,
slogging through the mud.

441
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:56,585
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

with a single swing of his sword.

Now the Tarlys bend the knee
like everyone else.

454
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:53,141
He could have lingered on the edge
of the battle with the smart boys,

455
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:56,811
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

456

You were only a squire, 16 years old.

You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

Best move l ever saw.

484
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:53,929
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

l never asked.

491
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,657
Did he call you a traitor?

492
00:34:13,782 --> 00:34:16,784
Did he plead for a reprieve?

493
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:21,331

Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?

497
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:08,795
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

498
00:35:08,878 --> 00:35:11,130
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

From whom?

lf you rule a city and you see the horde
approaching, you have two choices -

pay tribute or fight.

502
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:20,097
An easy choice for most.

503
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:23,601
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

504
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:27,105
Sometimes a khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

505
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:29,650
He might think the men too weak
or the women too ugly.

506
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:33,529
Sometimes a khal decides
his riders haven't had a good fight in months

00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:15,309
Eight. No, nine.

682
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:17,853
All of them brief?

683
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:21,023
They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.

684
00:49:21,148 --> 00:49:24,192
This summer has lasted nine.

685
00:49:24,317 --> 00:49:28,530
But reports from the citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

686
00:49:28,614 --> 00:49:30,991
The Starks are always right eventually -

687
00:49:31,116 --> 00:49:33,534
winter is coming.

688
00:49:34,452 --> 00:49:36,496
This one will be long...

689
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:39,541
and dark things will come with it.

690
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:44,253
We've been capturing wildlings,
more every month.

691
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:45,672
They're fleeing south.

692
00:49:45,797 --> 00:49:49,927
The ones who flee...
say they've seen the white walkers.

693
00:49:50,009 --> 00:49:53,304
Yes, and the fishermen
of Lannisport say they see mermaids.

694
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:56,891
One of our own rangers swore he saw them
kill his companions.

695
00:49:56,974 --> 00:50:01,021
He swore it right up to the moment
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

696
00:50:01,103 --> 00:50:05,567
The Night's Watch is the only thing
standing between the realm

697
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,070
and what lies beyond.

698
00:50:08,195 --> 00:50:13,742
And it has become an army
of undisciplined boys and tired old men.

699
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:16,494
There are less than a thousand of us now.

700
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:20,331
We can't man the other castles on the Wall.

701
00:50:20,498 --> 00:50:23,418
We can't properly patrol the wilderness.

702
00:50:23,543 --> 00:50:27,922
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed and fed.

703
00:50:28,047 --> 00:50:31,969
Your sister sits by the side of the king.

704
00:50:33,637 --> 00:50:36,306
Tell her...we need help.

705
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:41,228
When winter does come,
gods help us all if we're not ready.

706
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:05,585
[Speaks Dothraki] {Me rakh}
lt's a boy.

707
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:12,342
[Speaks Dothraki] {Kifinosi yer nesi?}
How do you know?

708
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:16,722
[Speaks Dothraki] {Anha sekke nesa.}
l very knows.

709
00:51:30,402 --> 00:51:32,612
[Wind blowing]

710
00:51:48,128 --> 00:51:50,422
l'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

711
00:51:52,298 --> 00:51:54,259
lt's either me or this cold,

712
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:56,637
and it doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

713
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:59,514
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?

714
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:00,849
l expect l will.

715
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:05,103
Gods know there aren't many feather beds
between here and King's Landing.

716
00:52:05,186 --> 00:52:07,230
lf you see my brother Bran,

717
00:52:07,313 --> 00:52:09,983
tell him l miss him.

718
00:52:10,775 --> 00:52:12,235
Tell him l'd visit if l could.

719
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:13,612
Of course.

720
00:52:14,695 --> 00:52:16,155
He'll never walk again.

721
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,076
lf you're going to be a cripple,
it's better to be a rich cripple.

722
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:22,579
You take care, Snow.

723
00:52:22,704 --> 00:52:24,539
Farewell, my lord.

724
00:52:36,425 --> 00:52:38,844
[Foreign accent] You are late, boy.

725
00:52:40,931 --> 00:52:43,224
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

726
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:45,601
Who are you?

727
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:49,523
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.

728
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:55,279
Tomorrow you will catch it.

729
00:52:55,404 --> 00:52:57,197
Now pick it up.

730
00:52:59,657 --> 00:53:01,951
That is not the way, boy.

731
00:53:02,034 --> 00:53:06,163
lt is not a greatsword that is needing
two hands to swing it.

732
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:10,251
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

733
00:53:10,335 --> 00:53:12,128
to make you strong.

734
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,630
Just so.

735
00:53:14,755 --> 00:53:17,050
One hand is all that is needed.

736
00:53:18,427 --> 00:53:20,429
Now you are standing all wrong.

737
00:53:20,554 --> 00:53:22,889
Turn your body sideface.

738
00:53:23,014 --> 00:53:25,266
Yes.

739
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:27,603
So.

740
00:53:27,728 --> 00:53:30,021
You are skinny. That is good.

741
00:53:30,813 --> 00:53:32,940
The target is smaller.

742
00:53:33,065 --> 00:53:35,152
Now the grip - let me see.

743
00:53:36,277 --> 00:53:37,905
Yes.

744
00:53:37,987 --> 00:53:40,657
The grip must be delicate.

745
00:53:41,742 --> 00:53:43,576
What if l drop it?

746
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:46,038
The steel must be part of your arm.

747
00:53:46,163 --> 00:53:48,789
Can you drop part of your arm? No.

748
00:53:48,873 --> 00:53:52,960
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

749
00:53:53,045 --> 00:53:55,797
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

750
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:57,632
l'm a girl.

751
00:53:57,715 --> 00:54:03,137
Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all.

752
00:54:03,262 --> 00:54:04,681
[He tuts]

753
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:06,599
That is the grip.

754
00:54:06,683 --> 00:54:09,686
You are not holding a battle-axe.
You are holding...

755
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:11,146
A needle.

756
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,898
Ahhh. [Chuckles]

757
00:54:14,775 --> 00:54:16,485
Just so.

758
00:54:16,527 --> 00:54:19,320
Now we will begin the dance.

759
00:54:19,487 --> 00:54:20,864
Remember, child,

760
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:23,824
this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning...

761
00:54:23,909 --> 00:54:27,746
The knight's dance,
hacking and hammering.

762
00:54:28,538 --> 00:54:31,583
This is the Braavos dance...

763
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:35,003
the water dance.

764
00:54:35,128 --> 00:54:37,297
lt is swift...

765
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,632
and sudden.

766
00:54:41,092 --> 00:54:43,302
All men are made of water.

767
00:54:43,427 --> 00:54:45,137
Do you know this?

768
00:54:45,222 --> 00:54:47,558
lf you pierce them,

769
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:51,270
the water leaks out and they die.

770
00:54:52,563 --> 00:54:55,773
Now you will try to strike me.

771
00:54:58,902 --> 00:55:00,695
Ha!

772
00:55:12,456 --> 00:55:13,833
Up!

773
00:55:14,793 --> 00:55:16,335
[Tuts]

774
00:55:17,337 --> 00:55:18,338
Ha!

775
00:55:29,724 --> 00:55:30,934
Ah.

776
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:35,021
Dead.

777
00:55:35,105 --> 00:55:36,105
[Laughs] Oh!

778
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:37,858
Dead.

779
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,817
- [Swords clashing]
- Hup!

780
00:55:42,404 --> 00:55:44,405
Very dead.

781
00:55:44,489 --> 00:55:46,324
- [Chuckles]
- [Syrio] Come.

782
00:55:47,034 --> 00:55:49,076
Ah ah ah!

783
00:55:49,202 --> 00:55:51,954
- Hup!
- [Swords clash]

784
00:55:52,663 --> 00:55:54,541
Again, faster.

785
00:55:59,003 --> 00:56:00,922
Ah.

786
00:56:01,088 --> 00:56:03,925
[Weapons clanging, warriors shouting]

787
00:56:05,088 --> 00:56:10,925
ARYA STARK IS GOING TO BE A BADASS!!!

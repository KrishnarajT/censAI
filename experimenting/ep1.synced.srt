1
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:13,263
(Gate rumbling, chains rattling)

2
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,586
(Horse snorts)

3
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,434
(Rumbling, chain rattling)

4
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,688
(Wind whistling)

5
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,285
- Easy, boy.
- (Grunts)

6
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,932
(Horse whinnies)

7
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,319
(Man) What do you expect?
They're savages.

8
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,821
One lot steals a goat from another lot,

9
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,282
before you know it
they're ripping each other to pieces.

10
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,868
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.

11
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,162
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

12
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,456
- (Horse snorts)
- How close did you get?

13
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,001
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the Wall.

14
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,088
Do the dead frighten you?

15
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,341
Our orders were to track the wildlings.

16
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,677
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

17
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,221
You don't think he'll ask us how they died?

18
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,267
Get back on your horse.

19
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,729
(Sighs, mutters)

20
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,483
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

21
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,193
They even killed the children.

22
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,154
It's a good thing we're not children.

23
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,325
You want to run away south,
run away.

24
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,370
Of course,
they will behead you as a deserter.

25
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,622
If I don't catch you first.

26
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,293
Get back on your horse.

27
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,754
I won't say it again.

28
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,565
(Shrill animal call)

29
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,371
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.

30
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,748
They were here.

31
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,795
See where they went.

32
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,896
(Echoing creature cries)

33
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,177
What is it?

34
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,596
It's...

35
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,557
(Cracking, creaking)

36
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,978
(Distant scream)

37
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,272
(Horses neighing)

38
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,107
(Galloping hooves)

39
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,887
(Snarling)

40
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,140
(Chittering)

41
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,276
(Coughing)

42
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,947
(Coughing)

43
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,074
(Panting)

44
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,951
(Labored breathing)

45
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,870
(Snarling)

46
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,999
(Gasps)

47
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,506
(Crackling)

48
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,599
(Chittering)

49
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,125
(Galloping hooves)

50
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,001
(Stamps)

51
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,133
Go on, Father's watching.

52
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,053
And your mother.

53
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,563
Fine work, as always.
Well done.

54
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,356
Thank you.

55
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:11,319
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.

56
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,237
Quite beautiful.

57
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,239
The stitching...

58
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,575
Oh, no, no, no. This stitch is very...

59
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,160
(Arrows impacting, men laughing)

60
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,245
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

61
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,504
(Arrow impacting)

62
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,302
- (Sighs)
- (Laughing)

63
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,180
And which one of you
was a marksman at ten?

64
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,724
Keep practicing, Bran.

65
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,853
Go on.

66
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,647
Don't think too much, Bran.

67
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,234
Relax your bow arm.

68
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,205
(Men laughing)

69
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,874
- Quick, Bran!
- Faster.

70
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,461
Lord Stark!

71
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,547
My lady.

72
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,801
A guardsman just rode in from the hills.

73
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,929
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

74
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,351
Get the lads to saddle their horses.

75
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,436
Do you have to?

76
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,647
He swore an oath, Cat.

77
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,774
Law is law, my lady.

78
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,860
Tell Bran he's coming too.

79
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,364
Ned.

80
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,783
Ten is too young
to see such things.

81
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,451
He won't be a boy forever.

82
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,122
And winter is coming.

83
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,476
Good lad, go run back and get the rest.

84
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,192
White walkers.

85
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,028
I saw the white walkers.

86
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,030
White walkers.

87
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,200
The white walkers, I saw them.

88
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,952
(Exhales)

89
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,627
I know I broke my oath.

90
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,338
And I know I'm a deserter.

91
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,884
I should have gone back to the Wall
and warned them, but...

92
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,053
I saw what I saw.

93
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,722
I saw the white walkers.

94
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,517
People need to know.

95
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,521
If you can get word to my family...

96
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,940
tell them I'm no coward.

97
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,026
Tell them I'm sorry.

98
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,711
(Whispers) Forgive me, Lord.

99
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,259
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

100
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,345
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

101
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,306
- ..King of the Andals and the First Men...
- Father will know if you do.

102
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,768
..Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

103
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,771
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

104
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,440
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North,

105
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,026
sentence you to die.

106
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,501
You did well.

107
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,155
You understand why I did it?

108
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,157
Jon said he was a deserter.

109
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,827
But do you understand
why I had to kill him?

110
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,579
"Our way is the old way"?

111
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,875
The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

112
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,296
Is it true he saw the white walkers?

113
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,301
The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.

114
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,970
So he was lying?

115
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,810
A madman sees what he sees.

116
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,671
What is it?

117
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,717
Mountain lion?

118
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,429
There are no mountain lions
in these woods.

119
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,375
(Pup whines)

120
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,394
It's a freak.

121
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,063
It's a direwolf.

122
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,574
Tough old beast.

123
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,954
There are no direwolves
south of the Wall.

124
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,123
Now there are five.

125
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,418
You want to hold it?

126
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,046
(Pup whimpers)

127
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,465
(Bran) Where will they go?

128
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,300
Their mother's dead.

129
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,969
They don't belong down here.

130
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,889
Better a quick death.
They won't last without their mother.

131
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:58,016
- Right. Give it here.
- No!

132
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,810
- (Whimpers)
- Put away your blade.

133
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,855
- I take orders from your father, not you.
- Please, Father!

134
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,773
I'm sorry, Bran.

135
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,941
Lord Stark?

136
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,236
There are five pups.

137
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,698
One for each of the Stark children.

138
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,325
- (Pup cries)
- The direwolf is the sigil of your house.

139
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,912
They were meant to have them.

140
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,336
You will train them yourselves.

141
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,338
You will feed them yourselves.

142
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,341
And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

143
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,685
What about you?

144
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,229
I'm not a Stark.

145
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,440
Get on.

146
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,532
(Whimpering)

147
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,951
What is it?

148
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,667
The runt of the litter.
That one's yours, Snow.

149
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,345
(Bells tolling)

150
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,022
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you...

151
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,276
you worry too much.

152
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,737
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

153
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,951
When we were seven and you jumped off
the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

154
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:25,455
100-foot drop into the water...
you were never afraid.

155
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,208
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told Father.

156
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,920
(Mimics) "We're Lannisters.
Lannisters don't act like fools."

157
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,885
- What if Jon Arryn told someone?
- But who would he tell?

158
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,387
My husband.

159
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,266
If he told the king, both our heads would be
skewered on the city gates by now.

160
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,937
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know,
it died with him.

161
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,648
And Robert will choose
a new Hand of the King,

162
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,360
someone to do his job while he's off
fucking boars and hunting whores.

163
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,154
Or is it the other way around?

164
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,033
And life will go on.

165
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,744
You should be the Hand of the King.

166
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,455
That's an honor I can do without.

167
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,206
Their days are too long,

168
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,000
their lives are too short.

169
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,257
(Thunder rumbles)

170
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:23,805
(Caws)

171
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,863
(Birds chirping)

172
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,749
All these years,

173
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,002
and I still feel like an outsider
when I come here.

174
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,506
You have five northern children.

175
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,051
You're not an outsider.

176
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,679
I wonder if the old gods agree.

177
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,807
It's your gods with all the rules.

178
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,899
I am so sorry, my love.

179
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,654
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

180
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,324
Jon Arryn is dead.

181
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,952
A fever took him.

182
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,999
I know he was like a father to you.

183
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,171
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

184
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,298
gods be good.

185
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,893
The raven brought more news.

186
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,398
The king rides for Winterfell...

187
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,235
with the queen and all the rest of them.

188
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,488
If he's coming this far north...

189
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,075
there's only one thing he's after.

190
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,579
You can always say no, Ned.

191
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,632
(Catelyn) We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

192
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,511
- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.

193
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,806
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

194
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,475
stature?

195
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,478
We've brought up eight barrels of ale
from the cellar.

196
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,812
Perhaps we'll find out.

197
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,773
In any case, candles.

198
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,823
Why is your mother so dead set on us
getting pretty for the king?

199
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,701
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

200
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,870
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

201
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,457
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab
with his right royal prick.

202
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,503
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

203
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,922
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

204
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,757
(Laughter)

205
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,586
- (Pup yaps)
- Gods, but they grow fast.

206
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,549
Brandon!

207
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,677
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

208
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,888
How many times have I told you?
No climbing.

209
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,975
But he's coming right now, down our road.

210
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,401
I want you to promise me,

211
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,194
no more climbing.

212
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,200
I promise.

213
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,414
- Do you know what?
- What?

214
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,749
You always look at your feet
before you lie.

215
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,793
(Chuckles)

216
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,670
Run and find your father.

217
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,839
Tell him the king is close.

218
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,637
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

219
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,107
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh.

220
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,151
What are you doing with that on?

221
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,656
- Go on.
- (Groans)

222
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,700
(Arya) Move!

223
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,428
(Neighs)

224
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,701
Your Grace.

225
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,874
You've got fat.

226
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,215
(Laughter)

227
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,512
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

228
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:27,103
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

229
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,774
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.

230
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,238
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

231
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,865
(Robert) Who have we here?

232
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,576
You must be Robb.

233
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,664
My, you're a pretty one.

234
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,959
Your name is?

235
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,461
Arya.

236
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,256
Oh, show us your muscles.

237
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,885
(Chuckles) You'll be a soldier.

238
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,182
(Arya) That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

239
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,434
(Sansa) Would you please shut up?

240
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:16,986
My queen.

241
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,864
My queen.

242
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,991
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

243
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,952
We've been riding for a month, my love.

244
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,079
Surely the dead can wait.

245
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,081
Ned.

246
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,967
Where's the Imp?

247
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,472
(Queen) Where is our brother?

248
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,349
Go and find the little beast.

249
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,395
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

250
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,857
One minute he was fine and then...

251
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,819
burned right through him,
whatever it was.

252
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,989
I loved that man.

253
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,449
We both did.

254
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,911
(Robert) He never had to teach you much,
but me? You remember me at 16?

255
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,872
- (Chuckles)
- All I wanted to do

256
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,624
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

257
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,878
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

258
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,630
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

259
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,591
(Both laugh)

260
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,051
(Sighs)

261
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,220
I need you, Ned,

262
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:28,016
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

263
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,686
Lord Eddard Stark...

264
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,106
I would name you the Hand of the King.

265
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,696
I'm not worthy of the honor.

266
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,239
I'm not trying to honor you.

267
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,074
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

268
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,912
while I eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave.

269
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,872
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

270
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,375
You helped me win the Iron Throne,

271
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,212
now help me keep the damn thing.

272
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,714
We were meant to rule together.

273
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,676
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

274
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,221
Well, it's not too late.

275
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,557
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

276
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,061
We'll join our houses.

277
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,067
(Woman moaning)

278
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,080
(Sighs)

279
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,127
(Cup falls)

280
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,214
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

281
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,423
(Giggles)

282
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,766
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

283
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,518
I did hear something about that.

284
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,812
And the queen and her twin brother.

285
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,982
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

286
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,984
And the other brother?

287
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,320
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

288
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,240
and there's the clever one.

289
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,034
Mmm...

290
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,412
I hear they call him the Imp.

291
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,330
I hear he hates that nickname.

292
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,834
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

293
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,211
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

294
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,797
prone to all manner of perversions.

295
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,716
Clever girl.

296
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,303
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

297
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,222
Have you?

298
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,724
- Already?
- Oh!

299
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,354
- The gods gave me one blessing.
- (Laughs)

300
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,522
(Door opens)

301
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,737
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

302
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:49,532
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

303
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,701
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

304
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,996
but our sister craves your attention.

305
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,707
She has odd cravings, our sister.

306
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,876
A family trait.

307
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,462
Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

308
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:07,425
- Don't leave me alone with these people.
- I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

309
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,887
And this is the first of many courses.

310
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,222
I thought you might say that.

311
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,975
But since we're short on time...

312
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,393
Come on, girls.

313
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,146
(Giggling)

314
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,151
See you at sundown.

315
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,362
(Tyrion) Close the door!

316
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,543
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

317
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,631
She should be on a hill somewhere

318
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,092
with the sun and the clouds above her.

319
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,260
She was my sister.

320
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,054
This is where she belongs.

321
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,557
She belonged with me.

322
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:05,233
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

323
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:11,072
It's done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.

324
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,202
Not all of them.

325
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,622
(Gull crying)

326
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,090
(Man) Daenerys!

327
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,970
Daenerys.

328
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,097
There's our bride-to-be.

329
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,684
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

330
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,854
Touch it.

331
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,189
Go on, feel the fabric.

332
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,112
Mmm.

333
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,116
Isn't he a gracious host?

334
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:02,165
We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.

335
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,167
Illyrio's no fool.

336
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,085
He knows I won't forget my friends

337
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,463
when I come into my throne.

338
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,552
You still slouch.

339
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,225
Let them see.

340
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,773
You have a woman's body now.

341
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,444
(Sighs)

342
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,667
I need you to be perfect today.

343
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,588
Can you do that for me?

344
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,719
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

345
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,722
No.

346
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,440
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

347
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,526
they will say it began today.

348
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,926
It's too hot, my lady.

349
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,689
(Gulls crying)

350
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,116
Where is he?

351
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,119
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

352
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,469
(Illyrio speaks Dothraki)

353
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,513
May I present my honored guests?

354
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,183
Viserys of House Targaryen,

355
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,810
the third of his name,

356
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:31,314
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

357
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,732
and his sister,

358
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,735
Daenerys of House Targaryen.

359
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,654
(Speaks Dothraki)

360
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,198
Do you see how long his hair is?

361
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,118
When Dothraki are defeated in combat

362
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,830
they cut off their braid
so the whole world can see their shame.

363
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:51,792
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

364
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:57,131
He's a savage, of course,
but he's one of the finest killers alive.

365
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,635
And you will be his queen.

366
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,304
Come forward, my dear.

367
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,553
Where is he going?

368
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,390
- The ceremony is over.
- But he... But he didn't say anything.

369
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,641
Did he like her?

370
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,520
Trust me, Your Grace,
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

371
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,900
(Illyrio) It won't be long now.

372
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,654
Soon you will cross the narrow sea
and take back your father's throne.

373
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:06,742
The people drink secret toasts
to your health.

374
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,328
They cry out for their true king.

375
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,750
When will they be married?

376
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,421
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

377
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,798
Is it true they lie with their horses?

378
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,843
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

379
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,095
Do you take me for a fool?

380
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,930
I take you for a king.

381
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,183
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

382
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:33,019
My apologies if I've given offense.

383
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,730
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

384
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,649
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

385
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,610
I don't want to be his queen.

386
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,075
I want to go home.

387
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,077
So do I.

388
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,539
I want us both to go home,

389
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,875
but they took it from us.

390
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,793
So tell me, sweet sister,

391
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,587
how do we go home?

392
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,466
I don't know.

393
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,843
We go home with an army.

394
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,222
With Khal Drogo's army.

395
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,435
I would let his whole tribe fuck you,

396
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,646
all 40,000 men and their horses too,

397
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,440
if that's what it took.

398
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,240
(Kisses)

399
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,251
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

400
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,587
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

401
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,132
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

402
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,136
He's so handsome.

403
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,015
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

404
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,227
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

405
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,020
Why would he say no?

406
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,065
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

407
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,234
He'd have to leave home.

408
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,904
He'd have to leave me.

409
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,032
And so would you.

410
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,493
You left your home to come here.

411
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,370
And I'd be queen someday.

412
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,873
Please make Father say yes!

413
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,792
- Sansa...
- Please, please!

414
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,795
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

415
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,926
(Music playing, people chattering)

416
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,015
(Laughter)

417
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,853
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

418
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,021
Come on!

419
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,899
Come here, you little beauty!

420
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,693
(Robert laughing)

421
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,000
Is he dead yet?

422
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:07,548
Uncle Benjen.

423
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,426
(Laughs)

424
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,760
You got bigger.

425
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,722
Rode all day.

426
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,433
Didn't want to leave you alone
with the Lannisters.

427
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,893
Why aren't you at the feast?

428
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,770
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

429
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,814
to seat a bastard in their midst.

430
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,026
Well, you're always
welcome on the Wall.

431
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,111
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

432
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,946
So take me with you
when you go back.

433
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,949
- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.

434
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,868
I know he will.

435
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,664
The Wall isn't going anywhere.

436
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,459
I'm ready to swear your oath.

437
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,712
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

438
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,756
We have no families.

439
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,593
- None of us will ever father sons.
- I don't care about that.

440
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,679
You might, if you knew what it meant.

441
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,518
(Sighs) I'd better get inside,

442
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,938
rescue your father from his guests.

443
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,026
We'll talk later.

444
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,787
(Tyrion) Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

445
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,084
What are you doing back there?

446
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,419
Preparing for a night with your family.

447
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,551
I've always wanted to see the Wall.

448
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,470
You're Tyrion Lannister,

449
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,138
the queen's brother?

450
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,932
My greatest accomplishment.

451
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,144
And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard,
aren't you?

452
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,775
Did I offend you? Sorry.

453
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,363
You are the bastard, though.

454
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,992
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

455
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,870
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

456
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,999
making you...the bastard.

457
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,128
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

458
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,089
Never forget what you are.

459
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,550
The rest of the world will not.

460
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,260
Wear it like armor...

461
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,346
and it can never be used to hurt you.

462
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,684
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

463
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,605
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

464
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,789
(Music playing, chattering)

465
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,499
(Laughter)

466
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,920
You at a feast...

467
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,548
it's like a bear in a trap.

468
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,135
The boy I beheaded...

469
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,389
- did you know him?
- Of course I did. Just a lad.

470
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,642
But he was tough, Ned,

471
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,019
a true ranger.

472
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,645
(Scoffs)

473
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,522
He was talking madness.

474
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,484
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.

475
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,903
The two he was with are still missing.

476
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:21,033
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

477
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,118
Maybe.

478
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,955
Direwolves south of the Wall,

479
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,291
talk of the walkers,

480
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,960
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

481
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,005
Winter is coming.

482
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,425
Winter is coming.

483
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,968
(They chuckle)

484
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,930
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

485
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,515
- How are you?
- I'm good.

486
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,892
(Laughter)

487
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,729
Is this your first time
in the North, Your Grace?

488
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,607
Yes. Lovely country.

489
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,739
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

490
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:06,412
I remember how scared I was when
Ned brought me up here for the first time.

491
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,207
Hello, little dove.

492
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,377
But you are a beauty.

493
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,796
- How old are you?
- Thirteen, Your Grace.

494
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,507
You're tall. Still growing?

495
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,467
I think so, Your Grace.

496
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,719
And have you bled yet?

497
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,309
No, Your Grace.

498
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,438
Your dress, did you make it?

499
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,484
Such talent.
You must make something for me.

500
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,448
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

501
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,658
I hear the same.

502
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,994
Your daughter will do well in the capital.

503
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,456
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

504
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,100
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

505
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,687
- I hope it's true.
- Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

506
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:17,024
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate
your new title, if you accept.

507
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,234
It would be good
to have you on the field.

508
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,737
The competition has become a bit stale.

509
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,114
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

510
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,782
Getting a little old for it?

511
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,618
(Chuckles)

512
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,786
I don't fight in tournaments

513
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,289
because when I fight a man for real,

514
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,166
I don't want him to know what I can do.

515
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,836
Well said.

516
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,547
- (Laughing)
- Arya!

517
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,593
It's not funny!

518
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,346
She always does this.

519
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,890
This was my favorite dress
and she ruined it.

520
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,476
She always does it
and it's not funny!

521
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,436
(Robb) Time for bed.

522
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,523
(Arya groans)

523
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,199
(Ned) I'm a Northman.

524
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:13,413
I belong here with you, not down south
in that rats' nest they call a capital.

525
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,209
I won't let him take you.

526
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,338
The king takes what he wants.

527
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,757
(Snorts) That's why he's king.

528
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,470
I'll say, "Listen, fat man."

529
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,638
(He laughs)

530
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,891
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

531
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,935
"He belongs to me now."

532
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,732
How did he get so fat?

533
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:45,153
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink. (Chuckles)

534
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,655
(Knocking)

535
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,199
(Man) It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

536
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,578
Send him in.

537
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,207
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

538
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,835
A rider in the night...

539
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,129
from your sister.

540
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,472
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

541
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,266
(Door closes)

542
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,731
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

543
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,400
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

544
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,744
(Ned) What news?

545
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,831
(Catelyn) She's fled the capital.

546
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,711
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

547
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,713
By the Lannisters.

548
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,507
She says the king is in danger.

549
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,885
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

550
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,637
She doesn't know what she's saying.

551
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:57,059
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now
if the wrong people had found that letter.

552
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,353
Do you think she would risk her life,

553
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,063
her son's life,

554
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,566
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

555
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,659
If this news is true...

556
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,329
and the Lannisters conspire
against the throne,

557
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,873
who but you can protect the king?

558
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,250
They murdered the last Hand.

559
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,586
Now you want Ned to take the job?

560
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:28,590
The king rode for a month
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

561
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,218
He's the only one he trusts.

562
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,555
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

563
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:39,267
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

564
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,395
He owes him nothing.

565
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,525
Your father and brother
rode south once

566
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,277
on a king's demand.

567
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,323
A different time.

568
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,785
A different king.

569
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,332
- (Noisy chatter)
- (Drumming)

570
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,564
(Hissing)

571
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,779
(Gasps)

572
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:01,475
When do I meet with the khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

573
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,020
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,
you shall have it.

574
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,190
- When?
- When their omens favor war.

575
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,860
I piss on Dothraki omens.

576
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,654
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.

577
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:27,000
- (Crowd ululating)
- (Grunting)

578
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,808
(Cheering)

579
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,402
(Speaks Dothraki)

580
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,987
(Blades clang)

581
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,873
(Screams)

582
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:19,553
A Dothraki wedding without at least
three deaths is considered a dull affair.

583
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,223
(Laughing)

584
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,276
(Speaks Dothraki)

585
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,194
(Speaks Dothraki)

586
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,953
A small gift, for the new khaleesi.

587
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,498
Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

588
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,585
Thank you, ser.

589
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,964
Are you from my country?

590
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,133
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

591
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,969
I served your father for many years.

592
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,055
Gods be good, I hope to
always serve the rightful king.

593
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,956
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

594
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,834
from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

595
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,879
The ages have turned them to stone,

596
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,964
but they will always be beautiful.

597
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,885
Thank you, Magister.

598
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,622
She's beautiful.

599
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,128
Ser Jorah, I...

600
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,006
I don't know how to say "thank you"
in Dothraki.

601
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,925
There is no word for "thank you"
in Dothraki.

602
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,073
Make him happy.

603
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,254
(Waves crashing)

604
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,468
- No.
- (Sobs)

605
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,640
Do you know the common tongue?

606
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,188
- (Pin clanks)
- No.

607
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,653
Is "no" the only word that you know?

608
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,489
No.

609
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,205
(Continues sobbing)

610
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,894
Rough night, Imp?

611
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,980
If I get through this without squirting

612
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,983
from one end or the other,
it'll be a miracle.

613
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,901
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

614
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:30,113
The greatest in the land -
my spear never misses.

615
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,158
It's not hunting if you pay for it.

616
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,252
Are you as good with a spear
as you used to be?

617
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,838
No, but I'm still better than you.

618
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,756
(Laughs)

619
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,467
I know what I'm putting you through.

620
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,261
Thank you for saying yes.

621
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,682
I only ask you because I need you.

622
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,436
You're a loyal friend. You hear me?

623
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,105
A loyal friend.

624
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,899
The last one I've got.

625
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,819
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

626
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:14,324
And I'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

627
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,911
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boar!

628
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,631
Come on, you.

629
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,022
(Whines)

630
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,532
(Grunts)

631
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,288
(Barks softly)

632
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,463
(Woman gasping)

633
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,344
(Woman moaning)

634
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,147
(Grunting, moaning)

635
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,873
(Gasps)

636
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,793
- Stop! Stop.
- (Gasps)

637
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,925
Are you completely mad?

638
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,553
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

639
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,722
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

640
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,974
I heard you the first time.

641
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,768
(Whimpers)

642
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,397
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

643
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,484
- How old are you, boy?
- Ten.

644
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:15,194
Ten.

645
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,372
- The things I do for love.
- (Gasps)

1
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,134
All right, already. Come on.

2
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,844
Step through here.

3
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,055
Behind the back. We're going.

4
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,224
Sir, thank you. That's him.

5
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,226
Excuse me. Excuse me.

6
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,312
- Pardon me. There he is.
- Keep it moving, folks.

7
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,314
- Torrio, you got a statement?
- Mr. Torrio!

8
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,941
Ask him who ordered the hit on Colosimo.

9
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:33,402
Mr. Torrio, is it true the police questioned you about Big Jim's murder?

10
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,988
- We was like brothers, me and Jim.
- Like Cain and Abel?

11
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,157
- Wiseacre, huh?
- Back off, creep.

12
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,160
- So why do you think he was killed?
- It was a robbery. How should I know?

13
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,037
Cops said nothing was taken.

14
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,497
Some respect for the dead, huh?

15
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,582
We understand the police have already spoken with you.

16
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,750
Is that true?

17
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,047
All right, folks, a couple steps back. There we go. All right.

18
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,507
Come on, keep it moving here.

19
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,884
Come on, here we go. Here we go.

20
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,821
- Watch the socks there, eh?
- Yes, sir.

21
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,952
You a family man, Harlan?

22
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,496
Got me a wife and four boys.

23
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,171
- Agent Van Alden.
- What?

24
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,591
- To see you.
- Nelson Van Alden,

25
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,052
Senior Prohibition Agent, Bureau of Internal Revenue.

26
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,015
Nucky Thompson.

27
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,811
Shoeshine? Coffee? Or something stronger maybe?

28
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,317
Nice that you boys have a sense of humor. Have a seat.

29
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,662
You're a difficult man to see. I've been waiting since 9:00 a.m.

30
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,582
Well, there's your mistake right there.

31
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,792
I don't keep regular hours.

32
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,671
That's a little odd for the county treasurer, isn't it?

33
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,383
Both I and the City of Atlantic march to our own drummers.

34
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,807
What can I do for you?

35
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,352
I'm investigating Saturday night's shootings.

36
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,479
What's to investigate?

37
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,398
We can all rest now that the architect of that slaughter's been killed himself.

38
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,485
- Hans Schroeder.
- A Hun.

39
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,738
Is it any wonder, though, the level of brutality?

40
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:45,785
Hans Schroeder was a baker's apprentice for the past 11 years.

41
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,748
He has one citation for public drunkenness,

42
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,708
Oktoberfest, 1912.

43
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,297
I wrote that summons myself. I used to be sheriff here.

44
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,634
- He pissed inside of a moving trolley.
- Yet no other criminal record.

45
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,595
Be that as it may, innocent people don't end up dead in fishing nets.

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,555
Not even in Atlantic City?

47
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,310
You know, you really should be speaking to our current sheriff.

48
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,938
- Your brother Elias.
- That's right.

49
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,280
Have you seen The Hottentot?

50
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,992
It's a terrific show. Laugh a minute.

51
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,495
And if you're stag, I can certainly introduce you to some eligible young ladies.

52
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,958
- I don't go in much for the theater.
- Then tell me what you do like.

53
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,129
I stopped by Schroeder's home. His wife isn't there.

54
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,047
You have any idea where I might find her?

55
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:43,509
Correct me if I'm wrong, but your bailiwick's alcohol, isn't it?

56
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,928
Shouldn't you be out somewhere raiding another still?

57
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,599
I suppose I march to the beat of my own drummer as well.

58
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,991
- How the hell did he get in here?
- He was waiting for...

59
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,701
- Get my brother on the phone.
- Ja.

60
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,161
- Now.
- Ja.

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,754
Citizens, countrymen, veterans, patriots,

62
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,675
join your white brothers in the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

63
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,552
Here you are.

64
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,888
Sir, take one.

65
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,099
We are a Christian,

66
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,811
fraternal, and pro-American organization governed by...

67
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,373
Thompson. Mr. Thompson.

68
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,084
Shit. What's this sap's name again?

69
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,504
It's George Baxter. He sells cutlery to the restaurants.

70
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,340
If it isn't good old Baxter. How's tricks, my friend?

71
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,758
I'm in clover, I tell you.

72
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:10,471
Business is grand and I just picked up this little chippy down in Baltimore.

73
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,682
Come here, doll. Say hello to Mr. Thompson.

74
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,519
- Hello.
- Name's Claudia. She's a shy little thing.

75
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,729
Not especially. Just sometimes.

76
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,190
Well, you're in good hands with this one, I'll tell you that.

77
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,819
- Thompson's a big cheese, big as they come.
- Some say a big rat.

78
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,031
How about it? Is he a card?

79
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,784
Well, I certainly hope you'll take in some of our attractions.

80
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,246
- We're gonna paint the town, kiddo.
- I wanna go roller skating.

81
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,792
Well, if you need anything, you know where to find me.

82
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,713
- Your friend's a big shot, huh?
- Old Baxy knows 'em all, baby.

83
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,103
Mrs. Schroeder, there's a Mr. Thompson here to see you.

84
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,479
Oh.

85
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,066
Yes, please.

86
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:08,154
- I wasn't sure if you wanted visitors.
- I'll need a moment.

87
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,166
It'll just be a minute.

88
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,668
She's just woken up from her nap.

89
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,674
You can come in now.

90
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,017
Mrs. Schroeder,

91
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,896
- Elias Thompson. I'm the sheriff.
- Yes, I know.

92
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:48,652
- You're looking well.
- I go home tomorrow, back to the children.

93
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,237
That's fine.

94
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,826
I wanted to talk to you about your husband... Late husband.

95
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,996
His involvement in illegal alcohol.

96
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,876
He was never in trouble a day in his life,

97
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,503
not in that manner.

98
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,006
The man beat you, Mrs. Schroeder.

99
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,717
He was not a murderer.

100
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,637
Didn't you just lose a child?

101
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,227
Did you ever follow your husband when he went out at night?

102
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,188
Of course not.

103
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,982
Questioned who his friends were, his associates?

104
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,359
No.

105
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,904
Then the fact is you don't really know what he was up to,

106
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,864
and he could have been involved in these shootings.

107
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,368
Well, I...

108
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,957
- I suppose anything...
- Then he could have been involved.

109
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,126
I suppose so.

110
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,337
Then, if anyone happens to ask, that's what you'll tell them.

111
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,007
- I don't see how...
- Your children,

112
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,010
Theodore, Emily?

113
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,347
I'm sure you'd be horrified if they ended up in the custody of the county.

114
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,727
Please, I meant no disrespect.

115
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,354
Of course not.

116
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,698
My brother would like you to have this.

117
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,285
Keep what we discussed in the forefront of your mind.

118
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,720
Who is he, the mayor?

119
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,181
He's the county treasurer, but he lives like a pharaoh.

120
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,475
The entire eighth floor of the Ritz.

121
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,935
All at the public's expense.

122
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:50,649
Grand furniture, crystal vases, oil paintings, tailored suits.

123
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:54,320
Drives a Rolls-Royce, too. At least his chauffeur does.

124
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,447
He's corrupt as the day is long.

125
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,824
And I'm not just talking about a little graft.

126
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,243
There isn't a single business he doesn't get a piece of.

127
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,415
- Fleming. What do you say?
- Two coffees.

128
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,669
Nor a public employee who doesn't pay for the right to hold his job.

129
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:14,214
His aldermen make the collections, then fill his coffers every week.

130
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,925
- Nucky.
- Look who's here.

131
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,761
- For the Ice Fund.
- Of course.

132
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,262
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

133
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,014
Sanitation, police...

134
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,682
- Right on time.
- Fire department.

135
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,267
The envelope catch on fire?

136
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,895
He's got the entire town paying off.

137
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,188
Yet they still vote him in.

138
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,441
The people love him, the darkies especially.

139
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,528
Remember, gentlemen, to vote excessively but smoke moderately.

140
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,532
Every waiter, busboy and porter swears allegiance to him come election time.

141
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,868
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

142
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:47,122
- No more bets.
- Casinos, whorehouses.

143
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,876
Even owns a wire service for the racing results.

144
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,628
White Shadow in the fifth.

145
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,506
- And alcohol?
- It hasn't slowed down a bit.

146
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,634
There's hardly a bar or a restaurant where you can't get a drink.

147
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,511
It's practically out in the open.

148
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:04,306
You went down to Atlantic City following Arnold Rothstein. What about him?

149
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:09,478
Frankly, sir, I'm beginning to think Nucky Thompson is the bigger fish.

150
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,566
How did she seem? Was she in good spirits?

151
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,902
She took the money, if that's what you mean.

152
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,487
A little defensive about the husband.

153
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,948
You should've dumped him like I told you. Side of the road somewhere.

154
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:22,825
"Get rid of him" is what you said.

155
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,453
- I meant publicly, so he could be identified.
- He was identified.

156
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:30,207
The fish could have ate his face off, Eli. He could have drifted to Nova Scotia.

157
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,334
Use your noodle next time, eh?

158
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,338
I'll be up front.

159
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,597
Mickey.

160
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,267
Mickey, wake up.

161
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,192
Jesus.

162
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,778
- What fucking took you so long?
- You're out, Mickey.

163
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,283
So long, sucker. See youse in the funny papers.

164
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:09,163
Not out of jail, out of business. Chalky White's taking over.

165
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,957
What are you talking about? Why?

166
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,251
You broke the cardinal rule, Mickey. You got caught.

167
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,462
That was a set-up. The fix was in from the beginning.

168
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,381
Shut the fuck up!

169
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,176
- What am I supposed to tell my partners?
- Tell them whatever you'd like.

170
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,386
The Feds know who you are now, Mick. You're contagious.

171
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,805
So you'll bail me out at least?

172
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,349
No can do. I can't risk them tying us together.

173
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,228
So you're just gonna leave me in here with slanty-eyes?

174
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,690
He don't even talk English!

175
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,902
Think of it as a way to broaden your horizons.

176
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,361
Nucky!

177
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:52,915
Go ahead.

178
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,251
Surprise!

179
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,295
Merry Christmas.

180
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

181
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,382
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

182
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,136
- What is this?
- It's Christmas. What does it look like?

183
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,971
It was Christmas over a month ago.

184
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,598
Yeah, but not like this, it wasn't.

185
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:13,143
- My God, what did you do?
- Nucky gave me a bonus.

186
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,021
I mean, why wait till next year, right?

187
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,857
The tree, I found it in the alley around the corner.

188
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,318
Say, pal, what do you think of this?

189
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,618
- Rip it.
- Here, I'll help you.

190
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,994
Truck!

191
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,788
That's right.

192
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,668
- Truck.
- Truck.

193
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,340
For you.

194
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,634
What is it?

195
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,307
Oh, my God!

196
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,728
Jimmy, this must have cost $100.

197
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,481
- Do you like it?
- Yes, of course.

198
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,567
Then let me worry about the cost.

199
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,652
Here, and this one, too.

200
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,737
Ta-da!

201
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,490
Is that a vacuum sweeper?

202
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,660
The fella said he can barely keep them in stock.

203
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,370
Here, plug it in.

204
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,588
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

205
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,172
It's a noise.

206
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,925
Don't worry, it's not gonna hurt you.

207
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,137
Come on, buddy.

208
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,139
Tommy, look.

209
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,851
Look, it's a vacuum sweeper.

210
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,437
- You see?
- Someone's very tired.

211
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,980
Mr. Rothstein, Charlie Luciano to see you.

212
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,406
We've got a special guest.

213
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,329
- Frankie Yale. How are you?
- A.R.

214
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,207
I understand you just got back from Chicago.

215
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,209
That's why you brung me here?

216
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,419
I asked him to, Frankie.

217
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,005
I was visiting a friend. So what?

218
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,342
It was a lousy visit, though.

219
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,929
For your friend, I mean.

220
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,932
Help yourself.

221
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,282
There was a man once.

222
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,953
I don't recall his name.

223
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,581
Frequented the billiard parlors downtown.

224
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,381
He made a comfortable living wagering whether he could swallow certain objects,

225
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,717
billiard balls being a specialty.

226
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,053
He'd pick a ball, take it down his gullet to here,

227
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,390
then regurgitate it back up.

228
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,313
And one evening I decided to challenge this man to a wager.

229
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,985
Ten thousand in cash for him to do the trick with a billiard ball of my choosing.

230
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:55,407
Now, he knew I'd seen him do this a dozen times,

231
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,785
so I can only surmise that he thought I was stupid.

232
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:03,206
We laid down the cash and I handed him the cue ball.

233
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,668
He swallowed it down.

234
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,670
It lodged in his throat,

235
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,840
and he choked to death on the spot.

236
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,385
What I knew and he didn't

237
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,097
was that the cue ball was one-sixteenth of an inch larger than the other balls.

238
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,224
Just too large to swallow.

239
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:36,364
Do you know what the moral of this tale is, Mr. Yale?

240
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,200
Don't eat a cue ball?

241
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,622
The moral of this story

242
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:49,211
is that if I'd cause a stranger to choke to death for my own amusement,

243
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,504
what do you think I'll do to you

244
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,548
if you don't tell me who ordered you to kill Colosimo?

245
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,121
Jimmy, honey,

246
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,208
it's not a good time.

247
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,837
I don't mind.

248
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,965
Let's do something else.

249
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,018
Maybe...

250
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,523
Maybe we could, you know, do it the French way.

251
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,525
What?

252
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,904
When we were outside Paris,

253
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:02,909
some fellas were talking about some gals they met that...

254
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,371
Oh.

255
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,165
You want me to put my mouth down there?

256
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,782
There were so many times when I would think of you.

257
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,785
I would get so hard.

258
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,584
- Mama! Mama! Mama!
- God damn it!

259
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,419
- It's okay.
- Shit.

260
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,421
Mama, where are you?

261
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,007
- Mama's right here, baby.
- I can't find you.

262
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,593
The kid's got timing, huh?

263
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,516
Are you hungry? You want me to fix you a steak?

264
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,353
No, I gotta do something.

265
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,318
We now take you to Ancient Greece!

266
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,582
Behold, the Sirens,

267
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,169
the stunning temptresses, who in their wickedness,

268
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,465
enticed Odysseus to dash himself upon the rocks.

269
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,894
Cue the waves crashing.

270
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,899
Sound, that's your cue!

271
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,110
Sound!

272
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,779
Let's break.

273
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,282
Five minutes.

274
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,912
I'm really thirsty.

275
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,872
- You want a something?
- Sure.

276
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,249
Yeah.

277
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,799
Jimmy!

278
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,845
Baby, baby, baby.

279
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,100
Jimmy.

280
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:35,937
My baby.

281
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,149
- Ma, it's all right.
- Baby, baby, baby.

282
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,611
Why didn't you write? I thought you were dead.

283
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,946
I'm fine.

284
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,951
I missed you so much. I missed you, I did.

285
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,205
It's all right. Come on.

286
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,791
Oh, my God! I'm shaking.

287
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,419
When did you come home?

288
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,838
I've been home over a month now.

289
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,633
- And you're just coming to see me now?
- I've been busy.

290
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,636
Come on, put on some clothes.

291
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,312
I...

292
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,982
I got you something.

293
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,528
What is this?

294
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,625
Jimmy.

295
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,503
It's okay. Come on, Ma.

296
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,340
- This is it. This is the one.
- It's close. It's very similar.

297
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:51,429
I had the same necklace years ago from his father.

298
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,348
I don't have a father.

299
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,143
She sold it to keep a roof over my head.

300
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,104
She's a good egg, your mom.

301
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,898
I promised you I'd replace it, didn't I?

302
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,069
Just having you back.

303
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,864
I don't know what to say.

304
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,642
What are you doing?

305
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,061
It's 4:30.

306
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,857
- I'm clocking in.
- Just like that?

307
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,987
I'd say our relationship has changed rather significantly in the past few days.

308
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,238
Wouldn't you agree?

309
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:57,662
- You tell me.
- Actually, why don't you tell me?

310
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,623
You can start with what the fuck happened the other night. How's that?

311
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,501
All right.

312
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,422
Did I invite you to sit?

313
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,637
Me and Al, we got to talking about life.

314
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,223
- Who's Al?
- Capone. He works for Johnny Torrio.

315
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,267
- The chubby kid?
- Yeah.

316
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,644
- Did Torrio sanction this?
- Only after the fact.

317
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,855
It was my idea. Mine and Al's.

318
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,941
We got to talking about life, family, money.

319
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,277
- He's got a little boy of his own.
- Young children at home

320
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,362
and there's no goddamn accountability whatsoever.

321
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,031
- I said I was sorry, Nuck.
- Really?

322
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,326
When was that?

323
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,286
I'm sorry.

324
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,540
I thought it would be easy, okay? Get the drop on them, swipe the truck.

325
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,918
- No one would get hurt.
- And me? Where'd I figure in?

326
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,545
- It would have never been traced back to you.
- Well, guess what?

327
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,924
A Fed came in to see me this morning, standing right where you are now,

328
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,509
- asking questions about Saturday night.
- What'd you tell him?

329
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,345
To bugger himself. What the fuck do you think?

330
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,388
There were deer in the woods.

331
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,057
Al got spooked. He started shooting.

332
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,808
So you kill four fucking guys?

333
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,394
- Five.
- Actually, there were four,

334
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,647
but let's not quibble over that little detail, shall we?

335
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,358
We couldn't leave any witnesses, Nuck.

336
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,570
- Fucking idiot.
- I screwed up, okay? I'm sorry.

337
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,906
I'm gonna make it up to you. I'll work extra hours.

338
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,325
Hold on there. Wait a second. You don't work for me anymore.

339
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,787
Let's get that straight right now. And you made that decision, not me.

340
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,665
- Well, who's gonna drive you?
- What's the difference?

341
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,751
You wanna be a gangster, kid? Go be a gangster.

342
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,004
But if you want to be a gangster in my town, then you'll pay me for the privilege.

343
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,052
That envelope you gave me, my end,

344
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,596
according to my calculations you're three grand short.

345
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,683
- What do you mean?
- Are you deaf and stupid?

346
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,978
You pull a stunt like that, ass-fuck me with Arnold Rothstein in the process,

347
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,437
you owe me another three grand.

348
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:50,608
- Nucky, I spent most of the money. - $3,000. You got 48 hours.

349
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,937
What'll it be?

350
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,232
I'll take a whiskey and a statement on the record.

351
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:32,900
How's that?

352
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,029
Eddie Corrigan, Chicago Tribune. I believe we already met.

353
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:39,073
- You drinking or what?
- Whiskey, like I said.

354
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,492
Three bucks.

355
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,663
- What's your name?
- AI Brown.

356
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,252
Hit me again.

357
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,634
I'm going with a story linking Johnny Torrio to the Big Jim murder.

358
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,764
- Why would you do that?
- Because I think it's true.

359
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,516
Would you like to make a statement?

360
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,519
Sure.

361
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,703
- What the fuck's going on?
- I'm making a statement.

362
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,010
Arnold Rothstein again.

363
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,100
Put on a black suit. You'll be driving me tonight.

364
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,769
Shall I wear a chauffeur's cap as well?

365
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,563
- If you want.
- I have to borrow one then.

366
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,817
Well, then, borrow one. Or don't. What are you asking me for?

367
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,277
But the chauffeur must have a cap.

368
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,990
Hello?

369
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,785
Nucky, Arnold Rothstein.

370
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,287
What a pleasant surprise.

371
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,039
Yeah, I'm sure.

372
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:12,667
So the reason I've been calling,

373
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,963
the delivery I arranged, I never received it.

374
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,423
You don't say.

375
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,925
The truck ran out of petrol. Who knows?

376
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,136
We'll chalk it up to a misunderstanding.

377
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,012
Chalk it up however you'd like.

378
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,472
Fine.

379
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,433
Then 100 grand should cover it.

380
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,600
Excuse me?

381
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,354
You owe me $100,000, Mr. Thompson.

382
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,774
It's bad enough you sold my load to Chicago.

383
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,571
My sister-in-law's nephew was one of those drivers.

384
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,948
I didn't sell your load to anyone,

385
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,200
and I don't care if your mother was one of the drivers.

386
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,952
Is this the way you do business?

387
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,914
You wanna see how I do business? Show your face again in Atlantic City.

388
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,025
Shit.

389
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,451
Jimmy?

390
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,205
Go back to sleep.

391
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,082
What are you doing?

392
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,337
Nothing, I'm... I'm getting something.

393
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,590
Is everything all right?

394
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,551
Go back to sleep.

395
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,762
You're gonna wake the baby.

396
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,346
- Mrs. Schroeder?
- Hello?

397
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,223
I'm Nelson Van Alden.

398
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,603
I'm with the Bureau of Internal Revenue. I'd like to speak to you about your husband.

399
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,362
Please.

400
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,661
Is this a bad time?

401
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,748
I'm just back from the hospital.

402
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,499
Oh, I didn't realize.

403
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,546
Please.

404
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,429
Sit.

405
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,255
First of all, my condolences.

406
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,801
I'm sure your husband was a fine and decent man.

407
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,015
I realize this is cold comfort,

408
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,937
but I have reason to believe that his murder is unrelated

409
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,439
to any alleged ties to bootlegging.

410
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,733
I don't understand.

411
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:52,446
He was a patsy, Mrs. Schroeder, a dupe set up to take the fall.

412
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,449
- By whom?
- I'm not sure yet.

413
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,786
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Please.

414
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,086
I... I had a ribbon.

415
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:12,383
What exactly is the nature of your relationship to Nucky Thompson?

416
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,525
- Hey, Nuck.
- Hey, champ.

417
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,278
Say, can you lend me a few bucks?

418
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,655
I'd like to, but I'm a little short.

419
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,449
That one kills me!

420
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,621
Look at the lovebirds. Looks like you're having a ball.

421
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,707
We're having a swell time, sure.

422
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,251
Saltwater taffy! Would you like some?

423
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,838
No, but you go ahead.

424
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,930
Talk about a flat tire.

425
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,601
Lionel Barrymore last night, dinner at the Knife & Fork,

426
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,437
champagne till dawn and not so much as a smooch.

427
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,564
- She looks like a pushover.
- That's what I thought.

428
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,319
What are you, about 20, 21?

429
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,072
Forgive me for asking. It's just that George and I were talking.

430
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,451
- I'm 19.
- Why, that's ideal.

431
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,287
You see, I'm thinking of sponsoring a beauty contest

432
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,830
right here in Atlantic City.

433
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:28,667
And if you don't mind my saying, you've got plenty of what it takes.

434
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,004
- A beauty contest?
- Naturally. Who doesn't love a pretty girl?

435
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,633
- What would I have to do?
- Keep in touch and I'll let you know.

436
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,177
Incidentally, Georgie here will be one of our judges.

437
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,346
- Really?
- Certainly.

438
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,307
- Thanks, Nuck. You're the darb.
- That ought to warm her up.

439
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,319
- Hello?
- Atlantic City, New Jersey,

440
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,029
to Chicago, Illinois.

441
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,449
Yeah. It took you long enough. I've been waiting a half-hour.

442
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,159
Go ahead, please.

443
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,119
Hello?

444
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,707
Al. Al.

445
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,337
- Come.
- Hello? Is anyone there?

446
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:14,797
Who's this?

447
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,049
Al, it's Jimmy.

448
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,927
- Jim Darmody.
- Who?

449
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:21,720
Jimmy, Atlantic City.

450
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,222
What gives?

451
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,266
I'm in a fix. I need your help.

452
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,809
What kind of fix? The coppers?

453
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,896
No, it's not that. I need money.

454
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:32,648
You blew all that dough already?

455
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,608
It's a long story.

456
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,028
I need you to wire me $500.

457
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,241
What? I didn't hear you.

458
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,412
I need you to go to Western Union and wire me $500.

459
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,039
I can't hear you, pal.

460
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,875
There's trouble on the wire.

461
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,418
Al.

462
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,378
Jimmy? Jimmy, are you there?

463
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,796
Al, can you hear me?

464
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,298
- I can't hear you.
- AI!

465
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,301
Call me back, pal. Sounds like you need help.

466
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:06,432
Son of a bitch! Al!

467
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,602
Operator. May I help you?

468
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,730
Yeah, you can go jump in a fucking lake.

469
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,612
Why is the money cold?

470
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,324
- It was in my pocket.
- You walked here?

471
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,159
I let Jimmy go.

472
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,162
It's time he struck out on his own.

473
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,497
Maybe it'll be good for him.

474
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,959
Toughen him up a little bit.

475
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,463
Pour me one of those cognacs, will you?

476
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,131
Fuckin' indigestion.

477
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:42,259
- You and me both.
- Stomach's been killing me.

478
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,929
So what do you hear from Trenton?

479
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,388
Senator Edge is coming down,

480
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:50,184
Frank Hague too from Jersey City, for my birthday.

481
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,394
Jesus.

482
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,397
A grown man still throwing himself birthdays.

483
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,942
Does that mean I should cancel your cooze for the night?

484
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,526
The fuck it does.

485
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,907
I'm hoping to pin Edge down on that road appropriation money.

486
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,409
You should horse-trade. The election's coming up.

487
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:08,911
He's got his eye on Washington.

488
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,579
I think he can go all the way.

489
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:13,749
- God knows the ladies like him.
- Yeah.

490
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,503
- That could be a lot of goddamn votes.
- That's a frightening thought.

491
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,965
A vote's a vote, isn't it?

492
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,759
You think so?

493
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,555
Louanne.

494
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,393
Louanne?

495
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,605
God damn it.

496
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,859
Louanne.

497
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,205
Jesus! What the hell are you doing back there?

498
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,456
Fixing your supper, Commodore.

499
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,166
When you hear this bell, get your ass in here.

500
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,669
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

501
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,088
Is there something I could do for you?

502
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,133
I want you to tell Mr. Thompson here

503
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,927
what your thoughts are on the League of Nations.

504
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,721
Beg your pardon?

505
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:12,182
Tell Mr. Thompson what your thoughts are on the League of Nations.

506
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,228
Big meeting there last week, right?

507
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,479
Paris?

508
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,107
I don't know what that is, sir.

509
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,279
Well, how do you feel about the Harriday Act?

510
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,781
- Holiday?
- Harriday.

511
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,118
Allows banks to operate through subsidiaries.

512
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,288
Sorry, Commodore,

513
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,374
I'm not versed in these matters.

514
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,295
Of course she isn't. She empties my piss pot.

515
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,309
That's your woman's vote.

516
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,983
We now take you to feudal Japan!

517
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,401
- Come on, come on!
- Jesus.

518
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:05,569
- What are you waiting for!
- That's us.

519
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,280
- The cue's coming.
- Come on, let's go.

520
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,659
- It happens every time.
- Yeah.

521
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,350
My dearest Rose,

522
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,146
I trust and pray to our Lord

523
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,483
that this missive finds you well

524
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,194
and in good spirits.

525
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,200
Important agency business keeps me from home.

526
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,995
For how much longer, I cannot say.

527
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,625
Please see to it

528
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,254
that you run the faucets at least twice a day,

529
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,509
as the winter weather can cause the pipes to crack.

530
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,973
Your devoted husband,

531
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,476
Nelson.

532
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,335
You know, you ought to grow a mustache.

533
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,629
What?

534
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,339
Sure.

535
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,592
Like Douglas Fairbanks.

536
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,346
Douglas Fairbanks belongs in Snake Alley with the other powder puffs.

537
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,349
You ask me, he's all man.

538
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,061
He's starring in The Mark of Zorro.

539
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,397
I'll put that on my list.

540
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,441
Mrs. Schroeder is here.

541
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,820
- Now?
- She says she must see you.

542
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,163
Who's Mrs. Schroeder?

543
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,874
Just wait in the car with Eddie.

544
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,551
- Mrs. Schroeder. What a surprise.
- I'm sorry. I know it's late.

545
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,178
It's nearly midnight. Where are your children?

546
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,222
They're with a neighbor.

547
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,559
Shall we?

548
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,815
Here, have a seat.

549
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,495
Mr. Thompson, I apologize,

550
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,165
but I need to return this.

551
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,294
Well, that certainly could have waited till tomorrow.

552
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,588
No, it couldn't.

553
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,591
That money,

554
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,261
I don't know what it is, what it's for.

555
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,598
It was weighing too heavily on my conscience.

556
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:48,935
Your conscience? Why should it do that?

557
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,235
With my husband gone...

558
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:05,911
I understand what you're going through, whatever the circumstances.

559
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:12,084
Was she very young, your wife?

560
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,381
Yes, she was.

561
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:19,800
Twenty-eight.

562
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:25,347
She was a beautiful, loving woman.

563
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,809
I'll keep her in my prayers.

564
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,019
Thank you.

565
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,899
When I came to you for help,

566
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:39,569
it was only to ask for employment for my husband.

567
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,490
I was a parlor maid back in Ireland.

568
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,492
With these soft hands?

569
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,541
My point is I wasn't seeking alms.

570
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,752
But we're Christians. That was the charitable thing.

571
00:45:55,837 --> 00:46:01,633
"Charity degrades those who receive it and hardens those who dispense it."

572
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,512
That's French or something, isn't it?

573
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,473
- George Sand.
- He was a poet.

574
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,851
He was a she, actually.

575
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,521
Baroness Amandine Lucile Dupin.

576
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,858
Sand was her pen-name.

577
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,444
My employer was a barrister.

578
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,571
The house was filled with books.

579
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:26,116
- And I'll bet you read them all.
- As many as I could.

580
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,872
Will you help me, Mr. Thompson?

581
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,584
All I want is to provide for my children.

582
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,879
I'd like to help you.

583
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,256
Then tell me what to do.

584
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,092
What do you want from me?

585
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:55,979
I want you to vote Republican.

586
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,616
- George, stop!
- Kiss me, baby. Come on.

587
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,870
- You see what you're doing to me?
- Stop getting fresh.

588
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,832
- Come on, honey. I'm crazy for you.
- Stop. I'm not that kind of girl.

589
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,752
Really? Well, what kind of girl are you? Huh?

590
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:26,009
- So, that's the way it's gonna be, huh?
- Come near me and I'll scream.

591
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,803
Come near you? Who can get close to you?

592
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,556
Get your things. I'm taking you back to Baltimore.

593
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,099
At this hour?

594
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,685
I've got headlamps, haven't I?

595
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:40,023
A guy comes home and he sees his wife in bed with a stranger.

596
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,858
He says, "What the hell are you two doing?"

597
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:44,736
She turns to the stranger and says, "See? I told you he was stupid."

598
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,571
Fella comes home to his wife and he says,

599
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:50,450
"Honey, pack your bags. I've just won the Irish sweepstakes."

600
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,454
She says, "Should I pack for warm weather or cold?"

601
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:58,291
"Doesn't matter to me," he says, "as long as you're gone by noon."

602
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,671
- You had one the other day.
- Nucky.

603
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,300
Sir James of the Absecon Isle.

604
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:16,977
I got what you asked for.

605
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,274
Do I need to count it?

606
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,318
Only if you don't trust me.

607
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:32,492
- So we're square?
- As a block of ice.

608
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:38,415
Gentlemen and ladies, to the tables.

609
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:51,177
Money plays. 3,000 on black.

610
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,513
Check. Play.

611
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,979
No more bets.

612
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,653
And the world turns.

613
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,828
Twenty three, red.

614
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,872
Not my night apparently.

615
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,042
- It's okay, baby.
- I know.

616
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,463
I've still got you, though. Right?

617
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:36,514
A waste of time, that's what this trip was.

618
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,391
There are plenty of girls.

619
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:42,687
Plenty who'd give their eye teeth for a time like I showed you.

620
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:47,067
Theater, champagne, fancy suppers.

621
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,569
Seventy dollars in a dress shop!

622
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,908
You could've shown a little gratitude, you know.

623
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,994
"Not that kind of girl."

624
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,956
What kind of girl goes away with a fella she just met, anyway?

625
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:06,211
You can forget about that beauty pageant, I'll tell you that right now.

626
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:09,005
All right, enough. Quit your jabbering.

627
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,757
Pull over.

628
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,093
Go on, do it.

629
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,443
You wanna kiss me? Go ahead.

630
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,320
You bet I do.

631
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,743
Go on, unbutton your trousers.

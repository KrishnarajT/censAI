(PEARL SCREAMS)

00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,768
(LAUGHING)

4
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,693
What the fuck is wrong with you?

5
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,987
Look at the soldier boy!

6
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,949
You'd have pissed your pants
if you were wearing any.

7
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,451
You think it's funny?

8
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,162
Easy, Princeton. I was fuckin' playing.

9
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,456
I need the keys to the car.

10
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,751
I can't hear out of my ear.

11
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,796
Quit your bellyaching and go back to sleep.

12
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,720
MAN: What the hell's going on?

13
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,514
It's okay. I'm okay.

14
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,311
- You're bleeding.
- What?

15
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,524
(GROANS)

16
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,030
This is never gonna work out.

17
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:06,412
What? No! Oh, come on.

18
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,622
You shouldn't have.

19
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,665
- Now, who planned this?
- KESSLER: Nucky?

20
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,584
Jesus! Fuck.

21
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,127
How long you been standing there?

22
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,129
I... Very shortly.

23
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,007
What do you want? I was rehearsing a speech.

24
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,552
Well, you asked to review
the guest list for the party.

25
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,804
Right, yeah.

26
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,556
Let's hear it.

27
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,934
Hank Adamo, Steven Mueller...

28
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:32,021
I'm giving a speech next week
to the Restaurant Workers Association.

29
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,023
What I was rehearsing.

30
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,776
Yes. Richard Berman...

31
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,569
I'm going shopping.

32
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,664
Get something pretty.

33
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,668
You know, you tore me apart last night.

34
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,169
Jesus, Lucy.

35
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,303
Make sure you invite Governor Edwards.

36
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,264
- He will not come.
- I know. Despite that.

37
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,559
Can you believe they elected
that asshole Democrat no-hoper?

38
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,437
I booked suites
for Senator Edge and Mayor Hague.

39
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,481
Visiting royalty.

40
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,483
Edge especially.

41
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,567
Hand me my shoes.

42
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,986
Which ones?

43
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,905
Oh.

44
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,702
- Make sure Edge gets the bigger suite.
- Mmm-hmm.

45
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,871
He's my ticket to that
road appropriations money.

46
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:31,956
Ja.

47
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,583
Almost $30 million for Jersey alone.

48
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,046
You can bet your keister
I'm gonna get a piece of that pie.

49
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,759
It's an expression, "a piece of the pie."

50
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,761
Don't you have pie in Germany?

51
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,638
We have strudel.

52
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,975
Just make sure everybody gets laid.

53
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,186
EDITH: "Could it be
the beautiful young woman

54
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,813
"found shivering in the river

55
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,441
"is actually who she claims to be,

56
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:03,154
"the daughter of the Czar of Russia,
the Grand Duchess Anastasia?"

57
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,948
It's like a fairy tale.

58
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,909
"Was she assassinated
at the hands of the Bolsheviks,

59
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:13,956
"or did she masterfully escape
the fate of her doomed royal family?"

60
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,125
- TEDDY: Give me it.
- Mine.

61
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,377
- EMILY: Give it to me!
- Pipe down or you'll get a spanking.

62
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,755
There's no need for that now, is there?

63
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,381
You spoil them.

64
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,925
Look at this. (GASPS)

65
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,805
"Anastasia Romanov,
thought dead these past three years,

66
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,642
"could very well be the rightful identity

67
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,772
"the amnesia victim
now claiming to be the princess."

68
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,816
- Who's a princess?
- You are, my darling.

69
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,485
And I'm the Queen of England.

70
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,944
Really?

71
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,155
Where's your sense of romance, Edith?

72
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,115
It left along with my husband.

73
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,742
Read the funnies, Mama.

74
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,994
- Mind your manners.
- Please?

75
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,080
All right, quickly.

76
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,915
Then I've got to leave for work.

77
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,919
Let's see what mischief
Mutt and Jeff have been up to.

78
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,844
Sorry, does it hurt?

79
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,514
A little bit.

80
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,475
You should try some opium.

81
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,770
There's a den in Chinatown. Let me take you?

82
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,481
I don't know. With all those hopheads?

83
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,692
It's divine, it really is. For whatever ails you.

84
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,537
That fella, Al, he can be
really scary sometimes.

85
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,040
He's all right. He's just from Brooklyn, is all.

86
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,251
Is that where you're from?

87
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,627
Atlantic City.

88
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,920
Mmm.

89
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,297
Star Prairie, Wisconsin.

90
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,633
Right, sure.

91
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,510
Don't pretend like you ever heard of it.

92
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,346
What's it like?

93
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,476
Well, Grandpa was
the first white man born in town,

94
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,687
Pa was the first man got sent to state prison,

95
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,606
and Ma was the first woman
run over flat by a car.

96
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,109
So you could say I've got a lot to live up to.

97
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,695
I'll say you do.

98
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,240
So did you really go to college?

99
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,659
Where'd you hear that?

100
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,578
Al's always calling you Princeton.

101
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,996
Yeah, well, where I come from,

102
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,499
some people had an idea
about what I was supposed to be.

103
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,585
- Your pa?
- No.

104
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,962
That's not something he'd do.

105
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,507
There's a fella, kinda like...
Kinda like Torrio here.

106
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,926
He saw me along through the years.

107
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,556
That's over with now.

108
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,766
So what's your idea?

109
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,435
Beg your pardon?

110
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,104
About what you're supposed to be.

111
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,439
Oh.

112
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,400
That's a good question.

113
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:47,943
Hmm.

114
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,989
I looked at your book
while you were sleeping.

115
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,240
Yeah? What'd you think?

116
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,578
I'm heading west myself,
like the girl in the story.

117
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,829
California, as soon as I save up.

118
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,414
You're gonna be in the pictures?

119
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,833
Gee, I don't know. Maybe.

120
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,169
Well, you're certainly pretty enough.

121
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,962
Don't kid a kidder.

122
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,631
You are.

123
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,674
You're prettier than Lillian Gish.

124
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,927
I'd watch you.

125
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,182
Would you save me from my brutish father?

126
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,476
He's out of prison?

127
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,563
Like Lillian Gish. Broken Blossoms?

128
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,067
I'd sure give it a shot.

129
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,987
Well, then maybe I'll let you come with me.

130
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,283
You'll let me?

131
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,285
I might.

132
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,205
How come?

133
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,501
'Cause I think you need taking care of.

134
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,641
NUCKY: What the fuck is taking you so long?

135
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,061
We've been trying, Nucky.
It ain't like we haven't asked around.

136
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,314
Asked around? You're trying
to solve a murder, not find a lost cat.

137
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,608
A cat would be easier.
Nobody cares about some colored kid.

138
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,944
Chalky cares, so that means I care.

139
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,822
And you can bet your ass,
come election day you're gonna care, too.

140
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,449
Control Atlantic City,
you control Atlantic County.

141
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,451
- Control Atlantic County...
- Control New Jersey, I know.

142
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,454
Well, if you know, then you'd know
how much we need the colored vote.

143
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,748
Like it or not, they're 20% of the city, Eli.

144
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,917
And they vote the way he tells 'em to,
so drink your damn coffee.

145
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,169
They vote the way I tell Chalky to tell them.

146
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,964
He drives a Packard, Nucky, because of you.

147
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,590
He lives in a house bigger than the mayor.

148
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,634
You seriously think he'd ever risk all that?

149
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,262
- Let his people vote Democrat?
- At this point, no.

150
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,472
But there are limits
to what he can sell those people,

151
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,474
and a lynching's not one of them.

152
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,518
- If word got out...
- He needs you, Nuck.

153
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,729
- No one's ever gonna know.
- And we need him.

154
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,399
One hand washes the other
and both hands wash the face.

155
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,152
Take a lot of suds to wash Chalky's face.
(CHUCKLES)

156
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,948
You can wait in the hall.

157
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,795
I don't like that fella. I never have.

158
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,506
He's a good man, Halloran, ready and able.

159
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,592
Just step it up, will ya?

160
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,138
Gillian, fix it.

161
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,599
Let me see, darling.

162
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,142
Gillian?

163
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,604
You know, most women
are proud to be called grandma.

164
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,149
Not while the peaches are still in season.

165
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,196
I shouldn't be very long.

166
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,572
Take your time.

167
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,116
I've got my man to keep me company.

168
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,119
- Say goodbye to Mama.
- Bye, Mama.

169
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,210
Let's see here.

170
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,297
They make such shoddy merchandise
these days.

171
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,133
You know, when your daddy was a little boy,

172
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,178
he had a blue tin train with big round wheels.

173
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,099
- A choo-choo.
- That's right, it was a choo-choo train.

174
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,102
And it was a gift from one of my admirers.

175
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,354
He was in the dry goods business.

176
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,731
All better.

177

00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,281
Mr. Torrio sends his regrets.

352
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,200
He had some pressing business to attend to.

353
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,577
What does he call this?

354
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,871
He says you should talk to me.

355
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,750
I gotta say this is very insulting.
I come all the way down here in the snow.

356
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,084
Trolleys ain't even running.

357
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,336
Can we offer you anything?
Some coffee, some whiskey?

358
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,463
No.

359
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,229
Forget California. Today, I'm heading east.

360
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,856

361
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,608
I'll see you later, okay?

362
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,824
So how's the Greek fella?

363
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,619
Probably at the dentist
getting the shoe leather out of his chops.

364
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,246
That fella gotta learn some manners.

365

Are you talking about me, pally?

367
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,420
Mr. Sheridan, we asked you down here
to work out a compromise.

368
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,924
The way that we see it,
Greektown is big enough for all of us.

369
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,009
SHERIDAN: You New York fellas
make me laugh.

370
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,261
You come out here from Brooklyn
or wherever the fuck,

371
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,971
and you act like you own the town.

372
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,100
- He's from Jersey.
- I don't give a fuck where he's from, boy-o.

373
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,434
He's in Chicago now.

374
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,270
Mr. Sheridan, I didn't mean any disrespect.

375
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,106
- The point is that we have ambition...
- The point is this.

376
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,566
You stay the fuck out of Greektown
or there's gonna be trouble.

377
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,735
We're already in Greektown, sonny.

378
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,655
We've been in Greektown
since Colosimo took over.

379
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,908
Maybe you didn't hear, but Colosimo retired

380
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,410
on account of that bullet in his fuckin' head.

he runs things now

382
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,167
and he's taking over your territory.

383
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,219
And what? There's no room for negotiation?

384
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:32,887
There might be.

385
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,557
How's about he take a piece of my action?

386
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,892
How much?

387
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,896
- Ten percent.
- Twenty-five.

388
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,984
All right, fine.

389
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,237

Fifty?

391
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,617
You heard me.

392
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,747
I don't want any trouble, okay?

393
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,792
Tell Torrio he gets what he wants.

394
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,266
Fuckin' loudmouth. I knew he'd cave.

395
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,645
That's one way of reading it.

396
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,077
I was born in Elgin, Texas.

397
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,289
My daddy taught himself the carpenter trade

398
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,625
doing for the black folk there.

399
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,919

403
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,181
Now one day, a man,

404
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,227
Mr. T.O. Purcell, come round.

405
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:06,606
He a white man, own his own store,

406
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,609
a stable, hotel.

407
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:15,073
He say to my daddy,
"I hears you the finest carpenter in Elgin."

408
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,202
My daddy tell him,
"Well, I can't say one way or the other,

409
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,080
"but I knows a bit about somethin'."

410
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:28,253
So Mr. T.O. Purcell take my daddy
to this house he was building,

411
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,213
biggest house in town.

412
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,840
They walk in there, say,

413
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:37,303
"This here gonna be the library.
What you think 'bout that?"

414
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,764
My daddy say,

415
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,558
"Well, I thinks you need some bookcases."

416
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,981
"Well then, that's what
I want you to make me."

417
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,067
Ten month my daddy work there.

418
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,362
And then when he finished,
he bring me around.

419
00:26:56,282 --> 00:27:00,535
"Mr. Purcell, this here's my boy.
I'd like to show him what I done."

420
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,539
"Come on in through the front door."

421
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,583
Just like that.

422
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,210
And we did.

423
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,213
When I seen them bookcases,

424
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,134
all carved with scroll and flowers,

425
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,886

426
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,890

427
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,979
that was the most beautiful thing I ever seen.

428
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,319
About a month later,
another man come round.

429
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,197
"I seen what you did for T.O.

430
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,868

431
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:46,080
"You come round my house
and I'll show you what I need."

432

May I present Senator Walter Edge
up from Washington,

527
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,367
and the honorable Frank Hague,
mayor of Jersey City?

Gentlemen, Mrs. Margaret Schroeder.

529
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,746
- Mrs. Schroeder.
- Ma'am.

530
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,081
- A pleasure, I'm sure.
- May I get you a drink?

531
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:29,335
- Whiskey, gin?
- Thank you, no. I don't drink.

532
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,546
Mrs. Schroeder is a member
of the Women's Temperance League.

533
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:33,881
Oh.

534
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,509
A fine organization.

535
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,760
It is.

536
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,765
Well, I guess I stepped in it. (LAUGHS)

You're not a suffragette, I hope.

538
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,395
- Not officially at least.
- Another one, eh?

539
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,983
I come from a country
where women already have the right to vote.

540
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,403
In fact, in most civilized countries
women are afforded that privilege.

541
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,405
Well, in this country,

542
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,243
we're simply trying to protect women
from the hard truths of life.

543
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:06,080
By denying them the right to take
a meaningful part in it?

544
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,165
It's a shame you see it that way.

545
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,542
It isn't just me, sir.

546
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,670
It's most women who'd like the right to vote.

547
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:17,007
And as you've learned, if you withhold from
a woman something she deeply desires,

548
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:20,469
then she'll surely find a way
to withhold something that you desire.

549
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,304
And what might that be?

550
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,806
Alcohol.

551
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,270
Well, now, they haven't done
a very good job of it now, have they?

552
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,355
Well, now, the party's only just started.

553

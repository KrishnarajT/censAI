1
00:00:01,145 --> 00:00:03,846
(Music playing)

2
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,433
(Watch ticking)

3
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:44,322
(Seagulls cawing)

4
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,493
(Bell ringing)

5
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:54,782
(Foghorn blows)

6
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,556
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
I'm a sitting duck out here.

7
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,056
So move then.
Come on.

8
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,341
Charlie.

9
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,677
Load it up.

10
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:27,980
Let's go, let's go!

11
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,314
Come on.

12
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:35,402
- Liquid gold, boyo.
- That's it.

13
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:49,881
(Music playing)

14
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:03,979
Come on, are we
fucking done here?

15
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:06,765
Boys, we're straight on to New York,
so anyone needs a piss,

16
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:08,715
you take it now.
No?

17
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,684
Then let's go.

18
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:31,203
Son of a bitch.

19
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:33,589
Hold up.
Slow down.

20
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,610
(Brakes squeal)

21
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,891
He's still breathing.

22
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,143
Fuck him.
Get him off the road.

23
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:03,365
- (Gun cocks)
- [Man]: Get 'em up!

24
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,402
Up!

25
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:08,821
Get your fucking hands in the air.
Drop the heaters.

26
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:11,624
- You stupid fuck.
- Drop it I said!

27
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:13,708
You too, fat boy.
Drop it!

28
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:15,910
Drop your weapon.

29
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:18,163
You know whose
fucking load this is?

30
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:20,298
It's pretty fucking
obvious now, ain't it?

31
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:23,451
[Woman]: "Coward, monster,
vicious brute,

32
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:26,386
friend to thief and prostitute,

33
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:29,789
conscience dulled by demon rum,

34
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:34,145
liquor, thy name's
delirium".

35
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,968
Tomorrow we awaken
to a new dawn.

36
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:45,471
And on the eve of this
momentous occasion,

37
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,857
it is my pleasure
to introduce...

38
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:51,476
Atlantic city's
esteemed treasurer,

39
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:54,812
the honorable enoch Thompson.

40
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:03,821
Mrs. McGarry, thank you
for that stirring poem.

41
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,624
Will you send me a copy?

42
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:08,292
[Woman]:
What a nice man.

43
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:10,676
Ladies.

44
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,794
Years ago there was a young boy

45
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:14,682
who lived in this very city.

46
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:18,268
The winter of '88,
some of you remember,

47
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:20,853
a blizzard
of biblical proportions.

48
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,805
The family was snowbound
and freezing,

49
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,227
without food or heat.

50
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:30,728
The father vanished...
laid to waste by

51
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,781
alcohol.

52
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,566
And so it was left

53
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:36,200
to this boy,

54
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,904
this little man of tender years

55
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:42,773
to fend for himself
and his family.

56
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:44,959
Off in the cold he went,

57
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:47,295
worn shoes wrapped in rags,

58
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:50,081
newspaper lining
his thin wool coat,

59
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:53,700
as he trudged
chest deep in snow

60
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:55,634
to the rail yard,

61
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:58,888
foraging on hands
and bloody knees

62
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:00,957
for scraps of coal,

63
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:03,542
hoping for some potatoes

64
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,709
spilled from a ruptured sack.

65
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:08,714
Finding none,

66
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:11,267
he took a broom handle...

67
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:16,854
and in desperation,
killed his family's dinner:

68
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:20,692
Three wharf rats hiding in the
hold of a ship.

69
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:22,093
(Gasps)

70
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:25,862
Terrible, yes.

71
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:28,198
But the family survived.

72
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:32,418
And the little boy?

73
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,790
Well, the little boy
speaks to you tonight

74
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:40,176
- from this very podium.
- (Applause)

75
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:45,463
Prohibition means progress.

76
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:49,718
Never again will families
be robbed of their fathers,

77
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:53,306
held hostage by alcohol.

78
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:55,140
How proud I am...

79
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:57,107
to live in a nation which,

80
00:06:57,142 --> 00:07:00,928
God willing, this year will finally
give s women the right to vote.

81
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:08,934
Ladies, I regret to inform you...

82
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:11,704
that I have been called away
on urgent county business...

83
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:14,791
and therefore will be unable
to stay for the potluck.

84
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:16,792
- (Groans)
- Shh-shh.

85
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:19,410
In closing, however,
let me say this:

86
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:23,382
Without the continued support
of good decent women...

87
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,951
like you, men like me...

88
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:28,787
would be nowhere.

89
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:32,090
Thank you and God bless.

90
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,816
In the trenches
once we ate dog meat.

91
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,934
But rats?

92
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:47,569
First rule of politics, kiddo:

93
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:50,240
Never let the truth get
in the way of a good story.

94
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:53,159
Barker: Come on in, boys!
Don't be shy.

95
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:57,146
Meet the gals who put
the "ooh" in ooh-la-la.

96
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:59,781
Step right up, friends.
Whatcha waiting for?

97
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:03,085
Lovely ladies
direct from Paris...

98
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,703
France.

99
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,039
- (Giggles)
- Young ladies,

100
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,006
I know there are attractions
that your parents

101
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,708
would like to take you to,
but this

102
00:08:09,758 --> 00:08:12,042
is not one of them.
Ladies, take them away, yes.

103
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,210
- They should have been gone a
long time ago. - (Laughs)

104
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:16,048
Don't be afraid, fellas.
They won't bite...

105
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:17,665
unless you want them to.

106
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:22,437
- Hey, Nucky, how you doing?
- Not as good as you, Wendell.

107
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:24,522
- Good evening, Nucky.
- Hey, how are ya?

108
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,973
- How are you, Nucky?
- Nice to see you.

109
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,692
(Band playing)

110
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,201
[Man]:
Say it ain't so, Joe.

111
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,479
To the end of the world!

112
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:14,099
(Baby crying)

113
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:17,103
All right,
take it easy, fellas.

114
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:21,106
I got it!
I got it! Over here.

115
00:09:21,156 --> 00:09:23,491
[Man]: Hey, you got some rye?
I want some gin... gin!

116
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:26,660
[Nucky]:
Thanks, ace.

117
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:38,337
- Is my brother here?
- Upstairs.

118
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,406
They all are.

119
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,394
(Laughing)

120
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,731
I wanted to arrest him, but he
had 24 hours left. I couldn't.

121
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:19,450
(Clinking glass)

122
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:21,451
Boys, boys, boys.

123
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:24,205
Mr. Mayor, friends,

124
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,407
fellow members
of the city council,

125
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,258
as you know,
in less than two hours

126
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:32,129
liquor will be declared
illegal by decree

127
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:35,749
of the distinguished gentlemen
of our nation's congress.

128
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,217
(Group moans)

129
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:40,337
To those beautiful,
ignorant bastards!

130
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,188
(Toasting)

131
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:46,926
Rest assured that dry
though the country may be,

132
00:10:46,943 --> 00:10:49,476
I am in the midst
of concluding arrangements

133
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:52,781
that will keep Atlantic city
wet as a mermaid's twat.

134
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:55,117
Jeez, Nucky,
you're fucking mermaids now?

135
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:56,736
Every vote counts,
Mr. Mayor.

136
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,155
[Man]: A republican
through and through.

137
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:02,872
The opportunity that is the Volstead act
has not merely knocked, my friends,

138
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:05,292
- it has kicked our fucking doors in!
- (Agreeing)

139
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:07,912
- I'll believe it when I see it.
- Come on, George,

140
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:09,830
it'll be like prohibition
never happened,

141
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:12,466
but for one thing...
prices will increase twentyfold.

142
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,552
What kind of sucker will pay three
clams for a drink worth 15c?

143
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:17,669
- You.
- You'll pay 12 clams...

144
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:19,838
for a piece of cooze
that ain't worth nothing.

145
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,792
Yeah, you pay.
You pay.

146
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,259
I know.

147
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:25,310
Now he's...
he's on the trolley.

148
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:27,397
Number one...
we got a product...

149
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,147
- a fella's gotta have.
- Yeah.

150
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:31,817
Even better is that we got a
product he ain't allowed to have.

151
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:34,486
- They might as well outlaw smoking.
- [Mayor]: A man's on holiday,

152
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,573
believe me, he wants a drink,
he'll pay the price for it.

153
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:37,874
- That's right.
- How about the law?

154
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:40,408
The law?
I am the law, Georgie boy.

155
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:43,694
Or are you so fucking soused
you thought I'm Lillian Gish, huh?

156
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:47,164
I mean this ain't a flower.
It's not a flower.

157
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:49,784
I'm gonna kick him outta here right now.
You're outta here.

158
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:51,751
- The feds!
- You're under arrest.

159
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:53,319
The feds, the fucking prohis.

160
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,921
Oh, the feds,
the fucking pro...

161
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:57,323
dogcatchers with badges.

162
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,259
With all due deference
to dogcatchers.

163
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:04,379
Now, as ward bosses,
you'll each be responsible...

164
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,382
for taking orders
and collecting...

165
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:08,934
from your restaurants,
hotels, what have you.

166
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:12,337
Those orders will be reviewed
by my brother and his men,

167
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:14,439
who'll supervise delivery.

168
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:16,307
Which brings me
to a few personnel changes.

169
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:18,676
- You all remember Jimmy Darmody?
- Welcome back, kid!

170
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:21,062
- Welcome home, Jimmy.
- Welcome back, kid.

171
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:22,730
- Good to see you.
- Gave them huns hell, I heard.

172
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:24,199
- Sure did.
- [Nucky]: He did.

173
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,650
And now that he's made
the world safe for democracy,

174
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:28,734
he's back to lend us
a hand too.

175
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:30,904
In three weeks paddy Ryan
is taking over...

176
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:32,789
as chief clerk
of the fourth ward.

177
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:34,690
Jimmy here'll be
pat's man Friday.

178
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,743
- Attaboy.
- Paddy.

179
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:39,046
- Congratulations, paddy.
- Gentlemen, it's an honor.

180
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,664
- Paddy Ryan... a good man.
- Look out, Mayor,

181
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:43,365
the kid'll have
your job one day.

182
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:45,050
He can have it
right now if he wants it.

183
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:47,553
- Give it time, Mr. Mayor.
- Welcome aboard, paddy.

184
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:49,922
(Chatting)

185
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:52,140
10, nine, eight,

186
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:55,176
seven, six, five,

187
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,045
four, three, two,

188
00:12:58,063 --> 00:13:00,546
one.

189
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:03,651
("Taps" playing)

190
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,335
Prohibition!

191
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,454
(Cheering)

192
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:08,709
(Growling)

193
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,661
Hey, where are you going?

194
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:14,632
- What's eating you?
- Nothing. I don't know.

195
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,553
- My stomach.
- Oh, go have a brioski.

196
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:32,516
- Will you look at this shit?
- James.

197
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:36,185
No, put it in your mouth.

198
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,022
Dempsey... "champ was
no draft dodger.

199
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,208
He explains his status
during war".

200
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:45,410
- So what did he say? - I dunno.
He supported his mother.

201
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:48,446
- It's a bunch of baloney.
- They couldn't write it if it wasn't true.

202
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,532
Wise up, Ange.
It's a bill of goods.

203
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,834
You think a fella would give
up that type of opportunity...

204
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,535
to go fight for his country?

205
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:59,373
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

206
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,128
Princeton wasn't exactly the
heavyweight championship, Angela.

207
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:09,550
Have you given it
any more thought?

208
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:12,518
I'd be 25 by the time I graduated...
almost 26.

209
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:15,554
- I could go to work.
- Doing what?

210
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:20,109
- Painting pictures?
- (Boy babbles)

211
00:15:20,144 --> 00:15:22,178
And what about skeezix here?

212
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:24,647
- Where are you going?
- Hey, sit down, eat your food.

213
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,781
No no, come on.
You gotta eat this mush.

214
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,500
Get up. Come on.
What about you, right?

215
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,600
- Yeah.
- Drink your milk.

216
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,036
One more bite.

217
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,855
You know, you could learn a lot
working for Ryan maybe.

218
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:40,628
- Are the eggs ready yet?
- Hold your horses!

219
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:44,382
Your mother's screwy if she thinks
I'm gonna work for a sap like Ryan.

220
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,083
- Ryan's a sap.
- Ryan is a sap.

221
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,085
Don't say that.

222
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:52,672
- I drank all my milk.
- Good.

223
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:56,926
So what are you gonna do?

224
00:15:58,428 --> 00:16:00,311
I'm gonna talk to Nucky.

225
00:16:01,764 --> 00:16:04,516
I don't know, two years
killing Jerries

226
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,934
doesn't exactly prepare you
for a whole lot else.

227
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:11,656
(Gunshots)

228
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:18,028
[Man]:
As prohibition agents,

229
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:21,397
you represent the finest
America has to offer...

230
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:25,202
the first line of defense in
the war against illegal liquor,

231
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,736
stout-hearted men,

232
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:31,256
centurions for the modern age,

233
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,712
unswerving in duty
and incorruptible...

234
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,563
in character.

235
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:40,380
Raise your right hands.

236
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,551
- I...
- I...

237
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,721
- State your name...
- (Names)

238
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,857
- Do so solemnly swear...
- Do so solemnly swear...

239
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:53,561
To uphold the laws of the
constitution of the United States...

240
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,897
To uphold the laws of the
constitution of the United States...

241
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:59,398
To root out criminality
in all forms...

242
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:01,934
To root out
criminality in all forms...

243
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:04,488
And vigorously uphold
all laws...

244
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:25,055
Nuck.

245
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,758
Nucky.

246
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:30,127
Oh.
What time is it?

247
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:32,130
2:30.

248
00:17:34,814 --> 00:17:37,302
- Nucky, are you up?
- What the fuck's the matter?

249
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,653
There's a lady waiting to see you.
She's been waiting over an hour.

250
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:43,106
She says it is urgent.
She's pregnant.

251
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,640
- (Woman moans)
- What?

252
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:49,413
- You met her last night.
- Last night?

253
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:51,196
She saw you talk or something.

254
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:53,648
Ah ah!
The tempremence league.

255
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,417
(Sighs)

256
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:58,337
- (Groans)
- Why didn't you say so?

257
00:17:58,371 --> 00:18:01,039
- I just did.
- "Pregnant woman here to see you"...

258
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,874
Give me a fucking nosebleed.

259
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:04,326
I... I... I...
I would never...

260
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:05,960
I am so sorry.
I would never inter...

261
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:07,878
- (door slams)
- Inter... interrupt.

262
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,596
I go. I...

263
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,600
Man: Gentlemen, welcome
to the Brighton.

264
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,435
We got a nice
high floor, right?

265
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,853
I want to look at the water.

266
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,807
Oh, rest assured, sir, all our
rooms have an ocean view.

267
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,506
- Boys.
- Mr. Torrio.

268
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:24,026
Rothstein.
See, I told you he'd come.

269
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:28,314
[Torrio]: Big Jim Colosimo,
Arnold Rothstein,

270
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,317
and Charlie Luciano.

271
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:32,117
Charlie, how are you?

272
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:34,235
(Speaking Italian)

273
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:38,489
How you doing?

274
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:40,525
Come on.

275
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:54,221
(Door opens)

276
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,341
You must please come this way.

277
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:04,562
David, I am so sorry I'm late.

278
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:07,767
Tell Nucky I ain't got all day.

279
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,153
(Clears throat)

280
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:15,523
Mrs. Schröder to see you.

281
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:23,947
Please, have a seat.

282
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,866
May I offer you tea?

283
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,787
- (Irish accent) Thank you, I'm fine.
- No, it's no trouble.

284
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:30,704
- Have you eaten?
- Thank you no.

285
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:33,122
I mean I have, yes.

286
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,126
I've eaten, but I...

287
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:37,343
Okay, relax.
Please.

288
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,847
- No more appointments.
- Ja.

289
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,351
Is that a bit of the old country
I hear in your voice?

290
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:49,221
My husband says I sound
like an immigrant.

291
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,523
Ah. But we're all
immigrants, are we not?

292
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,896
Tell me how I can help you.

293
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,599
First of all, sir,

294
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,701
I would never...

295
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,273
but when I heard
you speak, I...

296
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,492
There there now.

297
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,777
My apologies.

298
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:17,746
My husband,

299
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,583
he has a weakness
for the dice games.

300
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:23,970
He's a drinker as well
on occasion.

301
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,291
Is this your first child?

302
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:33,061
Our third.

303
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:35,263
We've a boy and a girl.

304
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:40,334
Do you have children
of your own, Mr. Thompson?

305
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,855
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:46,157
That was quite forward.

307
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:48,975
Not at all.
I do not.

308
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:54,330
I lost my wife to consumption.

309
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,869
Oh, I'm sorry.

310
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,720
She was very pretty.

311
00:21:02,757 --> 00:21:04,341
She was.

312
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,511
Hey, uh, Nucky?

313
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:11,713
- I'm gonna go now.
- Oh, I'm in a meeting.

314
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:13,681
No, please, I...

315
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:16,885
No, Mrs. Schröder,
Lucy Danziger.

316
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:18,635
Hello.

317
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:21,341
Hi.

318
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,612
So am I gonna see ya later?

319
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:32,148
I'll get in touch.

320
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:41,706
- I'm sorry. I...
- No.

321
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:44,793
- I... she's my...
- It's...

322
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,749
Does your husband work?

323
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,301
He's a baker's helper.

324
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:56,554
But till tourist season
and with winter,

325
00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:59,173
and the children
without boots, I...

326
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,344
Your story moved me so.

327
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:08,897
If you could see your way
to give him a job, sir?

328
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:13,687
As you say...
until tourist season.

329
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:17,322
However...

330
00:22:17,357 --> 00:22:19,324
This should see you
through winter.

331
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:21,025
I'm not here
looking for charity.

332
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,328
I insist.

333
00:22:25,248 --> 00:22:28,700
I don't know what to say,
how to thank you.

334
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:34,372
I'd be honored to name
my child after you.

335
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:36,507
Enoch?

336
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:38,593
You couldn't possibly
be so cruel.

337
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:44,431
Jimmy?

338
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:48,303
- See that Mrs. Schröder gets home.
- I'm fine to walk, please.

339
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:50,220
No no no, you are
in no condition.

340
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:53,088
- Thank you, Mr. Thompson.
- Sure.

341
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:54,755
Pardon me.

342
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,593
Your friends from Chicago checked in.
The New York gangs too.

343
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,694
- We're all set for tonight then?
- 8:00, the Traymore.

344
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:00,911
- Good.
- Say, Nuck,

345
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,313
I was hoping
to bend your ear...

346
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,616
Drop her off then meet me
at the pier later.

347
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:11,788
¶ The laddie told the girlie
he must go away ¶

348
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:16,294
¶ oh, and her little heart
with grief 'most broke ¶

349
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:18,496
¶ well, she said,
"you know I love you, honey ¶

350
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,664
¶ I love you, honey,
best of all ¶

351
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:25,418
¶ so, baby, don't go away" ¶

352
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:31,340
¶ just as he went to go ¶

353
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,894
¶ it grieved the girlie so ¶

354
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:39,315
¶ these words ¶

355
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:45,236
¶ he heard her say ¶

356
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,738
¶ some ¶

357
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,824
¶ of ¶

358
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:53,662
¶ these days ¶

359
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:58,198
¶ oh, you'll miss me, honey ¶

360
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:01,784
¶ some of these days ¶

361
00:24:01,818 --> 00:24:05,505
¶ you're gonna feel so lonely ¶

362
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:10,593
¶ you're gonna miss
my hugging ¶

363
00:24:10,628 --> 00:24:14,513
¶ you're gonna
miss my kissing ¶

364
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:18,717
¶ you're gonna miss me, honey ¶

365
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:24,890
¶ when I'm far away ¶

366
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:29,977
¶ I feel so lonely ¶

367
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:33,814
¶ just for you only ¶

368
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:37,849
¶ Mmm, you know, honey ¶

369
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:41,572
¶ I let you have your way ¶

370
00:24:41,622 --> 00:24:46,042
¶ and when you leave me ¶

371
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:49,129
- ¶ I know it will grieve me...
¶ - (Horn honks)

372
00:24:49,163 --> 00:24:50,881
[Mrs. Schröder]:
It's best you leave me here.

373
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:51,882
[Jimmy]: What was that?
- Please,

374
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:54,668
- could you leave me here?
- Right here?

375
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,467
- Okay.
- Thank you.

376
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:08,731
- May I help you inside?
- I'm fine.

377
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:10,481
- You sure?
- Thank you.

378
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:19,573
- Where have you been?
- I was, um...

379
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:21,441
Get in the house.

380
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:24,911
Who the hell is that?

381
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:32,251
- (Horn blares)
- (Music playing)

382
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:38,007
[Barker]: Gather around and
behold, ladies and gentlemen,

383
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,175
the catch of the day!
For Neptune yields...

384
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:43,845
the treasures from his
watery kingdom:

385
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:46,098
sea bass, eel, blue crabs,

386
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,133
king mackerel and flounder...

387
00:25:48,184 --> 00:25:49,433
Nucky.

388
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:52,970
Bill McCoy, as I live
and breathe.

389
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,606
- Have you been up north lately?
- Funny you should ask.

390
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,924
I just got back...
a little souvenir shopping.

391
00:25:57,942 --> 00:26:00,760
There are things you just
can't get back home anymore.

392
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,997
A load's coming in
tomorrow night.

393
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,115
(Bell rings)

394
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,435
Canadian club, straight
from the distillery.

395
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:11,788
500 crates at 100 clams per.

396
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,606
- That's a nice even number.
- It keeps the arithmetic easy.

397
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:17,826
- I am a simple fisherman, after all.
- Not anymore, you're not.

398
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,579
"And he took
the loaves and fishes,

399
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:22,964
looked at his disciples
and said,

400
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,799
'fuck it. We're goin' into
the whiskey business".

401
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:29,636
- How much for the whole kaboodle?
- (Whistles)

402
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,639
It's a big city, Billy boy,
a lot of thirsty people.

403
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:36,675
40 grand.

404
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:39,146
35 and we'll do it once a week.

405
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,663
What does that come to a crate?

406
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:43,650
A fuck of a lot more than you're
paying for it. That's for sure.

407
00:26:44,684 --> 00:26:46,819
Do we have a deal or no?

408
00:26:49,506 --> 00:26:50,690
Dirty chiseler.

409
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:52,891
You'll hear from my brother
about the particulars.

410
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:55,477
Where are you going?
I thought we were having a drink.

411
00:26:55,495 --> 00:26:57,913
I already got what I wanted.
What the fuck would we talk about?

412
00:26:57,947 --> 00:26:59,531
- (Snickers)
- Say, Nucky,

413
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:01,366
- about that thing.
- What thing?

414
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:03,667
- The thing I wanted to talk to you about.
- Wait, I gotta get cigarettes.

415
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:06,202
(Music continuing)

416
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:22,268
(People talking quietly)

417
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:28,557
- Nucky Thompson is here.
- (Gasps)

418
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:33,062
Mr. Thompson,
what an honor.

419
00:27:33,113 --> 00:27:35,780
He was a good man.
My deepest condolences.

420
00:27:35,815 --> 00:27:38,850
I hadn't even realized
you knew my husband.

421
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:42,654
Oh, of course. He was a fine fellow.
Just last month we spoke.

422
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:44,789
Oh...

423
00:27:44,823 --> 00:27:46,572
But the laryngectomy.

424
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,092
Fellas, meet the missus.

425
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,893
She ain't much on personality,

426
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:10,562
but she don't talk back none neither.
(Giggling)

427
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:14,883
What's the matter, kid,
never seen a stiff before?

428
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:18,185
I've seen a couple.

429
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,655
I'm short on time, Mickey.
What'd you want to show me?

430
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,109
(Sighs) So much for the niceties.

431
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:32,898
(Giggling)

432
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,701
(Music playing)

433
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:37,403
(Chatting,
glassware clinking)

434
00:28:44,594 --> 00:28:46,344
My factory, gentlemen.

435
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:49,047
- Quite an operation.
- 10 shiners,

436
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,217
two shifts, 24 hours a day...

437
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,051
Gotta figure we're puttin' out
close to 2,000 crates a week.

438
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:55,938
And that's just for starters.
(Giggles)

439
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:59,256
- None of this is legit?
- Not once they get through with it.

440
00:28:59,274 --> 00:29:01,192
One part real,
eight parts water.

441
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:04,561
You heat it up, let it cool then add
your alcohol to bring up your proof.

442
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:07,097
- Where do you get your alcohol?
- Potatoes.

443
00:29:07,115 --> 00:29:10,618
You let 'em ferment.
It smell's rough,

444
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:12,903
but compared to a stiff,
it's fuckin' lilacs.

445
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:14,870
(Giggles)
After you add the alcohol,

446
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:17,708
you throw in your caramel
coloring, your oil of rye,

447
00:29:17,743 --> 00:29:19,943
bourbon... depending
what you want.

448
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:22,628
- You can make scotch too?
- Naturally.

449
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,329
You just gotta add some
carbonyl though for the bead.

450
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,783
- What's that?
- The bubbles.

451
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:29,386
Higher the proof,

452
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,586
more bead it's supposed
to have.

453
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,672
Go on, bottoms up.

454
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:41,478
(Laughing)

455
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:46,432
- What the fuck's in this shit?
- Carbonyl, like I said.

456
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:48,902
Formaldehyde.
(Giggles)

457
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:51,438
- Formaldehyde, huh?
- Hey hey hey hey!

458
00:29:51,471 --> 00:29:54,474
- What are you doing?
- Cocksucker!

459
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:57,208
(Gasps)

460
00:30:01,914 --> 00:30:04,616
What the hell's wrong with you?
Out!

461
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,151
Now! Beat it.

462
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:10,005
Jimmy, out!

463
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:17,127
- Stupid bohunk.
- It was just a gag, okay?

464
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:20,464
- Yeah, you're a real pistol.
- Enough with the bohunk cracks.

465
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:23,099
- My name's Doyle now.
- What?

466
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:26,034
I changed it.
I ain't Mickey Cusick no more.

467
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:29,289
- Who's after you?
- Nobody.

468
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:32,492
- Then why Doyle?
- It sounds better is all.

469
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:34,963
A rose by any other name.

470
00:30:34,996 --> 00:30:37,196
What's that supposed to mean?

471
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:39,582
Read a fucking book.

472
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:45,973
- What, are you off your nut?
- You didn't drink that piss, I did.

473
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:48,392
- You're still breathing, aren't you?
- Yeah, so's he.

474
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:50,508
That's the problem...
he's still breathing.

475
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:53,895
- He's part of my operation, kid.
- You don't need him.

476
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,349
What would you know about it?

477
00:30:56,383 --> 00:30:59,484
What's with you? And don't tell
me it's your goddamned stomach.

478
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:01,653
You want to know what's with me?
Honestly?

479
00:31:01,686 --> 00:31:04,104
- Yeah.
- Paddy Ryan.

480
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:07,024
You really expect me
to go work for that Mick?

481
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:09,109
You'd rather be my driver?

482
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,777
Of course not, Nuck.
It's just you... you...

483
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:13,529
make Ryan clerk?
I can run rings around that chump.

484
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:16,732
Oh, listen to Bonnie
prince Charlie.

485
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,402
C'mon, Nuck, you were assistant
sheriff when you were my age.

486
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,956
And for eight years prior I spent night
and day kissing the commodore's ass.

487
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,924
I've been kissing your ass
since I was 12!

488
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,792
And what about
the last three years?

489
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,629
I wanted to serve my country.

490
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:32,931
- And nearly get yourself killed.
- Sssh.

491
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:35,801
Did it ever occur how your
girl might feel about that?

492
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,637
- Your little boy?
- Look, if that was my fate, then so be it.

493
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,922
And he wants to be in politics.

494
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,359
You know who dies for their country, kid?
Fucking rubes, that's who.

495
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:49,529
Yeah well, I'm home now, Nuck.

496
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:52,565
- So how about it?
- Had you stayed in school,

497
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,867
it'd have been you
in that job and not Ryan.

498
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:57,371
All right, so you're punishing me.
Is that it?

499
00:31:57,406 --> 00:31:59,790
- You're punishing me.
- I'm telling you to slow down,

500
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:02,708
get the lay of the land.
You've been home now what? A month?

501
00:32:04,943 --> 00:32:07,279
Nucky, I'm not
the same kid that left.

502
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:12,552
I've seen things.

503
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:16,721
- I've done things. - Well, how are
we gonna keep you down on the farm?

504
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,956
- I'm serious.
- I know.

505
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:22,310
All right, look,

506
00:32:22,344 --> 00:32:24,295
that's 1,000 bucks.
Go buy yourself...

507
00:32:24,313 --> 00:32:26,430
- a decent suit...
- I don't want your money!

508
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:29,183
A fella hands you a grand,
you tell him to fuck himself?

509
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,634
You're a pip, kid, I gotta say.

510
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:35,272
Nucky, all I want
is an opportunity.

511
00:32:35,305 --> 00:32:38,524
This is America, ain't it?
Who the fuck's stopping you?

512
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:42,578
Come on, let's go.

513
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:45,697
- [Mrs. Schröder]: One for you.
- [Girl]: Two!

514
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:49,117
- And two.
- Two pile of soups.

515
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:51,454
And one for you.

516
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:56,957
[Mr. Schröder]:
The automobile?

517
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:59,092
Tell me again how you came
to find yourself...

518
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:01,513
getting chauffeured
around town.

519
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:05,132
I told you.

520
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:08,268
I was walking past the church
when I felt faint.

521
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:10,003
Mr. Thompson saw me...

522
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,805
and was kind enough to have
his driver see me home.

523
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:17,360
C'mere.

524
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:27,453
You are a little warm.

525
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:31,622
And you're feeling better
now though, are you?

526
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:33,291
I am.

527
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:38,080
And this?

528
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,947
How this find its way
under the mattress?

529
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:40,899
Mommy...

530
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,400
That money belongs
to the children.

531
00:33:42,418 --> 00:33:45,086
Like fuck it does!
Where'd you get it?

532
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:47,586
- Huh?
- Never you mind where I got it.

533
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:50,006
- By whoring yourself out?
- (Screams)

534
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,476
- You whore!
- (Wailing)

535
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:57,813
- You gimme that money.
- No, you sit down...

536
00:33:57,847 --> 00:33:59,815
or you'll get the belt!

537
00:34:03,554 --> 00:34:05,971
- Eat your food.
- I want mommy!

538
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:09,240
- Eat your food.
- (Wailing)

539
00:34:12,276 --> 00:34:14,445
(Music playing)

540
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:18,116
Ahh.

541
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:19,733
Ohh.

542
00:34:19,752 --> 00:34:21,567
Thank you.

543
00:34:24,037 --> 00:34:25,838
[Torrio]:
This is them.

544
00:34:27,842 --> 00:34:29,626
Gentlemen.

545
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:31,961
Enoch Thompson.

546
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:34,096
- (Pats)
- Okay.

547
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,432
- Big Jim Colosimo.
- Ah, Mr. Thompasoni.

548
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:38,299
- Nice to see you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

549
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,802
[Nucky]: Come on in.
Now if you come back here in July,

550
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:42,920
at the pool they have
the sea nymph festival.

551
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:45,756
- Seamina festival?
- You should come for that.

552
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:47,943
- Got them.
- [Nucky]: Like mermaids.

553
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:50,229
January 16th,
it's 8:03 pm.

554
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:52,597
Johnny Torrio meeting
with Nucky Thompson.

555
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:55,282
- Which one's Torrio?
- The gray tweed.

556
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:57,534
"Gray tweed".

557
00:34:57,569 --> 00:34:59,569
(Bell dings)

558
00:34:59,604 --> 00:35:02,606
We got a bead on Rothstein.
He just came in with Luciano.

559
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:04,940
This other fellow
is big Jim Colosimo.

560
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:07,126
- Come again?
- In the Homburg.

561
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:09,429
- The Hamburg?
- The Homburg.

562
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,381
Never mind.
He took it off.

563
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:15,000
- Who's this fella now?
- Who?

564
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:17,052
- The guy in the brown suit.
- That's the concierge.

565
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:20,922
- It's "Sierge"?
- The manager, he works here.

566
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:25,092
So the red tie, that's big Jim?

567
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:28,179
Does that man look big to you?

568
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,798
- How's that?
- It's Arnold Rothstein.

569
00:35:30,817 --> 00:35:32,982
So it's not Colosimo?

570
00:35:33,017 --> 00:35:37,403
- Arnold Rothstein.
- And Nucky Luciano.

571
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:38,738
- Lucky!
- Come again?

572
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:41,524
Lucky Luciano,
Nucky Thompson.

573
00:35:42,778 --> 00:35:46,312
So... who's Colosimo?

574
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:48,664
(Growls)

575
00:35:48,698 --> 00:35:50,999
- (Classical music playing)
- (Chatting)

576
00:35:56,124 --> 00:35:58,674
Fella goes to divorce court.
The judge says...

577
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:01,043
"I've decided to give
your wife 25 dollars a week".

578
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:02,660
Fella says "that's mighty
swell of you, judge.

579
00:36:02,678 --> 00:36:05,363
I'll try to send her a few clams
myself now and again".

580
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:11,602
- Clams?
- Money.

581
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:14,105
Clams, money, capiro?

582
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,273
Money, capiro?

583
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,842
You should put it
in some lobster too, no?

584
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,264
No!

585
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:25,899
No no no.
None for me.

586
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:27,850
You're a law-abiding
citizen, eh?

587
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:29,984
- No, teetotaler. Never touch it.
- Oh.

588
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:33,239
- He's the lightweight.
- I like to stay sharp at the tables.

589
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,075
Yeah, sharp.
The way he wins, he wants to be sharp.

590
00:36:36,126 --> 00:36:39,879
Last year he clear 2 million
just of the world series alone, eh?

591
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:42,864
- Two milliones.
- And they call that one lucky.

592
00:36:42,882 --> 00:36:45,083
What do you think
I'm sitting next to him for?

593
00:36:45,134 --> 00:36:47,668
Hey, boy, do you have
any Caruso records?

594
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:50,420
- Enrico Caruso?
- That's fine.

595
00:36:50,472 --> 00:36:52,256
- Caruso, no?
- Go find some and play it.

596
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:53,841
- Put it on, eh?
- Tell the boys.

597
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,759
It's like funeral music here.

598
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:57,877
- (Laughter)
- How's the chow, fellas?

599
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,596
- Fine.
- Delicious.

600
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:01,714
[Colosimo]:
Oh, ma, she's the best, eh?

601
00:37:01,732 --> 00:37:03,383
You should come to my
restaurant sometime, eh?

602
00:37:03,384 --> 00:37:05,184
- Sure.
- I treat you nice, eh?

603
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:07,236
Come on, if you like to eat,
you eat.

604
00:37:07,271 --> 00:37:09,489
If you don't like to eat...

605
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:13,275
- Hmm?
- Who doesn't like to eat?

606
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:17,113
- (Singing in Italian)
- Chicago's a fine town.

607
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:18,830
It ain't New York,
that's for sure.

608
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,698
New York ain't New York now
with prohibition.

609
00:37:20,732 --> 00:37:22,918
It will be if I have
something to say about it.

610
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:25,036
Ain't that the reason
we're all here tonight?

611
00:37:27,406 --> 00:37:29,790
As you know, in light
of recent developments,

612
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:32,676
I thought it might be of mutual
benefit for you boys to meet.

613
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:35,629
All the way from chi-town out
of the goodness of his heart.

614
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,098
When I say mutual benefit,
I mean mine too.

615
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:40,099
I didn't come here
for the pastasciutta.

616
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:43,553
I'll be expecting
a matchmaking fee.

617
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:45,637
Of course.

618
00:37:45,688 --> 00:37:49,609
See, in addition to their other enterprises,
Messrs. Rothstein and Luciano...

619
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:53,062
have significant interests in the
cabaret business back in New York.

620
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:54,779
And a man such as yourself,

621
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:57,782
with both political influence as
well as a passing acquaintance...

622
00:37:57,816 --> 00:37:59,867
with the seafaring types
of the Atlantic ocean...

623
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:02,036
hey, Johnny, talk English.

624
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,290
Salvatore...
(Speaking Italian)

625
00:38:07,209 --> 00:38:08,242
...Big business.

626
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:10,211
[Luciano]:
So what's the difference?

627
00:38:14,298 --> 00:38:16,332
Go ahead, do what you
were going to do.

628
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:18,951
Could you fix us up or no?

629
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,172
We'll take alls we can get
up to 2,000 crates a month.

630
00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:24,391
For starters.

631
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:30,262
You young fellas...

632
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:32,848
no appreciation for
the art of conversation.

633
00:38:36,735 --> 00:38:38,486
All right, yeah, I gotta piss.

634
00:38:43,492 --> 00:38:44,909
I apologize.

635
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:49,313
Ambition can be read
as impatience sometimes.

636
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,666
- Arrogance too.
- Ehh...

637
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:56,253
I have a friend...
a judge.

638
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:58,454
His daughter's wedding
is in a week.

639
00:38:58,488 --> 00:39:02,043
I'd like to be able to accommodate
him and their 700 guests.

640
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,592
- You haven't stockpiled?
- Mmmm.

641
00:39:04,627 --> 00:39:07,096
All sold already.
I'm coming up short.

642
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:11,383
Well, I have a load
coming in tomorrow.

643
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,718
500 crates Canadian club.

644
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,889
Originally I'd planned to keep it,
but seeing how I'd like to start

645
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:20,057
our relationship off on the right
foot, how about I let you have it?

646
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,360
- How much?
- 60 grand for the entire load.

647
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:25,863
But you use your own men
for the pickup.

648
00:39:34,988 --> 00:39:37,790
Send me over the details,
we'll settle up in cash tomorrow.

649
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:39,526
All right.

650
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,710
All right, gentlemen,

651
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:43,696
- salut.
- Salut.

652
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,964
Cheers.

653
00:39:44,998 --> 00:39:46,749
Cheers.

654
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,967
I was in Chicago once.

655
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:53,889
- Good steaks.
- It's all right.

656
00:39:53,923 --> 00:39:56,008
A little cold,
but so is Brooklyn.

657
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:58,042
You get used to it, I guess.

658
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:01,228
Summer of '17 I passed through there
on my way to Camp Grant.

659
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:04,815
Doughboy, huh?

660
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,884
- Uh-huh.
- Me too.

661
00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:08,886
The lost battalion.

662
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:11,104
No kidding.

663
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:15,275
How about you?
You see any action?

664
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,577
Little bit.

665
00:40:17,611 --> 00:40:20,279
Caught some shrapnel
from a Jerry's grenade.

666
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:24,165
- Spent eight months in the hospital.
- Jesus.

667
00:40:27,704 --> 00:40:30,122
Say, let me ask you something.

668
00:40:31,073 --> 00:40:32,873
A guy like Rothstein,

669
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:34,841
what's a fella like that worth?

670
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:38,296
Him?
10 million at least.

671
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:40,515
- On the level?
- He's as big as they come.

672
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:43,751
Christ, Luciano's sitting
on a half a million.

673
00:40:43,768 --> 00:40:47,087
I know that for a fact.
Got a spread on park Avenue.

674
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:50,224
You make that much
running card games?

675
00:40:50,258 --> 00:40:51,857
Card hijacking.

676
00:40:51,892 --> 00:40:54,144
He's a fucking
dope peddler too.

677
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:57,029
Did six months for pushing
heroin a couple years back.

678
00:40:57,062 --> 00:40:59,032
But he only did six months?

679
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:00,866
Yeah, he bought a judge.

680
00:41:00,901 --> 00:41:02,868
Oh right.

681
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,237
Jeez, a half million dollars...
can you imagine that?

682
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:09,375
How old is...
what is he, like our age?

683
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:11,777
22, 23 maybe.

684
00:41:19,886 --> 00:41:23,138
You guys gonna get into
the liquor business too?

685
00:41:23,172 --> 00:41:26,590
Losimo says no.
Too much heat from the law.

686
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:29,958
Says there's enough money
in our whorehouses.

687
00:41:29,976 --> 00:41:32,228
But you don't agree?

688
00:41:32,262 --> 00:41:33,431
I'm Johnny's muscle.

689
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,032
- Who gives a fuck what I think?
- Yeah.

690
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,350
[Nucky]: If you get
in trouble, don't call me.

691
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:39,852
You call my brother.
And so what you want to do...

692
00:41:39,902 --> 00:41:43,071
just ask for lolly.
He'll be expecting you.

693
00:41:44,657 --> 00:41:46,825
I'd wish you luck, but it
sounds like you don't need it.

694
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,642
- We make our own luck.
- True enough.

695
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,161
Hey, nice talking to you, huh?

696
00:41:50,195 --> 00:41:52,364
- You too.
- Jimmy Darmody.

697
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:54,499
- Al Capone.
- All right, Al.

698
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:57,701
Mr. Thompson, thank you
very very much.

699
00:41:57,736 --> 00:42:01,255
The lobsters are very good.
You paid. I'm a happy man.

700
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:03,591
Next time we come to your
place, you pay for it.

701
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,625
- Eh, any time.
- You kick in the clams.

702
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,327
- Ahhh!
- A joke, yeah.

703
00:42:08,344 --> 00:42:10,830
- Thanks again. A pleasure.
- [Colosimo]: You come to Chicago,

704
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:12,933
- I fix you up.
- All right.

705
00:42:12,968 --> 00:42:16,386
- (Speaks Italian)
- Jimmy, stop with the clams.

706
00:42:16,437 --> 00:42:18,789
- But, you know...
- It's a joke.

707
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,590
Americans...
they like to make a joke.

708
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,241
(Piano playing)

709
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:41,385
(Laughing)

710
00:43:00,598 --> 00:43:02,934
- Hey, slow down, champ.
- You buy me candy.

711
00:43:02,986 --> 00:43:05,238
No Taffy.
He looks like fatty Arbuckle Jr.

712
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:07,720
- Hey!
- No no no, sweetie, sweetie.

713
00:43:07,738 --> 00:43:09,521
- This way, sweetie.
- Come here.

714
00:43:09,555 --> 00:43:11,074
- This way.
- Come here, Tommy.

715
00:43:11,107 --> 00:43:12,824
- Stay with daddy.
- Come here.

716
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:15,893
- Maybe we should get a photo.
- No, I don't feel like it today.

717
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:18,329
James Darmody?
Ma'am.

718
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,412
- That's right.
- Special Agent van Alden,

719
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:22,081
bureau of internal revenue.

720
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:25,334
- Can I help you?
- Perhaps.

721
00:43:25,368 --> 00:43:27,537
- Will you come with me?
- Jimmy.

722
00:43:29,922 --> 00:43:31,456
It's okay, dear.
Go on home.

723
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:33,457
What's this about?

724
00:43:33,507 --> 00:43:35,290
It's fine.
I'll see you at home.

725
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,591
Thank you, ma'am.

726
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:44,381
[Agent]:
Distinguished service cross,

727
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:47,633
battle of Saint...

728
00:43:47,683 --> 00:43:50,018
- How do you say this?
- Mihiel.

729
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:53,471
Seems to me...

730
00:43:53,521 --> 00:43:55,388
you're a man on the come.

731
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:58,022
I'm doing all right.

732
00:43:58,057 --> 00:44:00,275
College man too...
Princeton.

733
00:44:02,095 --> 00:44:03,695
For a while.

734
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:08,898
Am I in trouble or something?

735
00:44:08,932 --> 00:44:11,150
Guilty conscience?

736
00:44:12,536 --> 00:44:14,786
You mind telling me
what a go-getter like you

737
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,353
is doing working
for a crook like Thompson?

738
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:22,126
It's not like that Mr. Thompson
is a pillar of our community.

739
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,411
Tell it to Sweeney. We know all about him
and his little fiefdom.

740
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:26,912
The election rigging,
the graft...

741
00:44:26,945 --> 00:44:29,245
None of which
we're interested in.

742
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:33,717
- What're you interested in?
- Liquor...

743
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:36,717
Its illegal importation
and manufacture.

744
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,625
How'd you like to come
work for the bureau?

745
00:44:51,796 --> 00:44:54,314
- I got a bum leg.
- Suppose I say you don't?

746
00:44:57,315 --> 00:45:00,316
You got a wife,
young son at home.

747
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:06,773
It's an honorable
profession, James,

748
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:08,992
plenty of room for advancement.

749
00:45:12,693 --> 00:45:15,278
It's a godly pursuit.

750
00:45:23,703 --> 00:45:25,786
Could I have one
of those cigarettes?

751
00:45:27,988 --> 00:45:30,089
- Give him a light.
- Sure.

752
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:36,711
You do go to church,
don't you, Mr. Darmody?

753
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:42,548
Yeah, sure.

754
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:44,933
Well then...

755
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:47,268
you know, right?

756
00:45:50,887 --> 00:45:54,724
Yeah... what?
Know what?

757
00:45:56,726 --> 00:45:58,928
(Moaning)

758
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:01,644
- Giddy up, cowboy.
- Lucy, stop... stop saying that.

759
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:04,313
Come on, daddy.

760
00:46:04,347 --> 00:46:06,868
- Giddy up, cowboy.
- Lucy, stop!

761
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:09,117
- What?
- With the cowboy shit.

762
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:12,035
- It's distracting.
- Okay, Nucky, come on.

763
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,820
- (Loud moaning)
- Oh yeah.

764
00:46:19,793 --> 00:46:21,411
- (Knock on door)
- [Eddie]: Nucky!

765
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:24,045
- (Grunts)
- What?!

766
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,380
I heard screaming.
Are you alright?

767
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:29,132
- (Sighs)
- May I enter?

768
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:32,916
- No! What do you want?
- Steinman's on the wire.

769
00:46:32,969 --> 00:46:34,502
Oh Christ.

770
00:46:34,536 --> 00:46:37,638
- What?
- All right.

771
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:40,756
He is always interrupting us!

772
00:46:40,808 --> 00:46:43,058
Jeez Louise.
(Growls)

773
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,892
What?

774
00:46:46,144 --> 00:46:49,480
Screaming?
We were fucking, Eddie!

775
00:46:49,514 --> 00:46:51,715
Fucking.

776
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:55,482
(Slams)

777
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:57,852
- Hello?
- It's Lolly.

778
00:46:57,886 --> 00:47:00,154
Hey listen, your friend
from New York, the bankroll?

779
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,557
- He just took us for 90 grand.
- What?

780
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:06,024
16 hours and he wants
to keep going.

781
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:08,693
We ain't that flush
right now, Nuck.

782
00:47:11,946 --> 00:47:13,947
All right, I'll be right there.

783
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:20,117
- [Nucky]: Eddie!
- Yea-ah?

784
00:47:20,168 --> 00:47:24,003
- Tell Jimmy to bring the car around.
- Jimmy called to be out sick.

785
00:47:24,038 --> 00:47:27,006
(Sighs) Son of a bitch.

786
00:47:28,873 --> 00:47:30,375
(Door rattles)

787
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,376
- Lucy, open the door.
- No!

788
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:34,378
Oh, come on, baby.
I gotta get dressed.

789
00:47:34,412 --> 00:47:36,545
No fucking way!

790
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:38,596
- (Sighs)
- Go spend time with Eddie.

791
00:47:38,631 --> 00:47:40,682
He's obviously more
important than me.

792
00:47:40,716 --> 00:47:42,134
I...

793
00:47:42,184 --> 00:47:44,968
no, he's not more
important than you.

794
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:48,805
But Arnold Rothstein
and 90,000 dollars is more important!

795
00:47:48,857 --> 00:47:51,139
- Open the goddamn door!
- No!

796
00:47:53,777 --> 00:47:54,792
(Groans)

797
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:56,593
Why don't you go
hang out with him?

798
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,146
- (Lucy shouting)
- Yeah, you do it. My back.

799
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,531
Get in there.
Yeah yeah!

800
00:48:01,564 --> 00:48:04,365
Please, Lucy, it's very
important for Eddie to come in.

801
00:48:04,399 --> 00:48:07,784
- Open the...
- Open the fucking door!

802
00:48:13,106 --> 00:48:15,123
(Music playing)

803
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:28,617
- Where is he?
- Eating with the Italian fellow.

804
00:48:28,634 --> 00:48:31,502
I didn't want to say nothing,
but this Rothstein's a cheater.

805
00:48:31,552 --> 00:48:35,171
Honestly, if he wasn't who he is, they'd
have found him in a fucking alley.

806
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:38,140
- Well, he is who he is.
- That's why I called.

807
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,096
You fellows ever hear of sleep?

808
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,062
Who can sleep
with all this excitement?

809
00:48:50,934 --> 00:48:52,516
I heard luck had nothing
a lucky to do with it.

810
00:48:53,652 --> 00:48:55,986
I'm a skilled player
is what he means.

811
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,971
- That's what I hear.
- Mmm, so?

812
00:48:58,988 --> 00:49:00,741
What's all this
about cutting me off?

813
00:49:00,775 --> 00:49:03,325
It's not that.
It's a small house.

814
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,826
We just can't handle your kind
of action right now.

815
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,245
Your credit's good with me.

816
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,496
Why don't we get to know
each other better?

817
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,164
I don't think I like
what I'm hearing.

818
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,750
Maybe you shouldn't be listening
to the grown-ups' conversations.

819
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:17,785
- How is that?
- Charlie, sit down.

820
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:19,987
Charlie... Charlie.

821
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,794
(Pats)

822
00:49:30,828 --> 00:49:33,178
As of now, you owe me...

823
00:49:33,212 --> 00:49:35,930
well, 93 grand.

824
00:49:35,964 --> 00:49:40,217
Less 60 for tonight's load
knocks it to 33.

825
00:49:40,267 --> 00:49:42,334
So you could keep playing then.

826
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:44,353
I don't gamble where
I don't feel welcome.

827
00:49:44,387 --> 00:49:47,307
I'm sorry you feel that way.

828
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,024
Cash him out.

829
00:49:53,346 --> 00:49:55,446
Thompson, right?

830
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:59,347
I heard you're familiar
with my wife.

831
00:50:00,983 --> 00:50:03,350
- Pardon?
- My wife.

832
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:06,237
Margaret...
you drove her home.

833
00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:11,790
- Where'd you get that money?
- What business is that of yours?

834
00:50:11,824 --> 00:50:13,574
That money belongs
to your wife.

835
00:50:13,608 --> 00:50:15,709
Oh, so it was you
who give it to her.

836
00:50:15,744 --> 00:50:18,745
- Here, you prick. I'm winning anyway.
- (Crowd gasps)

837
00:50:18,796 --> 00:50:22,048
- [Dealer]: Hey hey!
- (Grunts)

838
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:24,496
Toss him the fuck out.

839
00:50:31,538 --> 00:50:33,707
All right, we went over
the rules in the locker room.

840
00:50:33,725 --> 00:50:36,089
I want a good clean fight.
No holding, no low blows,

841
00:50:36,138 --> 00:50:38,841
break when I tell you.
Now touch gloves and come out fighting.

842
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:40,226
(Bell dings)

843
00:50:52,184 --> 00:50:54,153
(Laughing)

844
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:57,888
Hit him!
Fucking hit him.

845
00:50:57,906 --> 00:51:01,075
[Man]: Keep your right up.
Hook, jab, jab, jab.

846
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:03,577
(Shouting)

847
00:51:08,082 --> 00:51:10,898
If I was you I'd bet
on the little guy.

848
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:14,168
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a fight fan.

849
00:51:14,203 --> 00:51:16,952
What else?

850
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:18,957
(Laughing)

851
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,626
So how much you know
about this haul...

852
00:51:24,678 --> 00:51:27,759
that's coming in tonight
for Rothstein?

853
00:51:32,747 --> 00:51:36,583
I tell you, for a fellow good-looking
as me, I sure do get the homely girls.

854
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,602
- (Snickers)
- I don't mind the homely ones,

855
00:51:39,053 --> 00:51:41,937
especially when they're dumb.
I love the dumb ones.

856
00:51:41,972 --> 00:51:44,188
My girl is so dumb,

857
00:51:44,223 --> 00:51:46,590
she thought that daylight
savings was a bank.

858
00:51:48,357 --> 00:51:49,756
My girl is so dumb, she thinks

859
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,394
long island sound
makes a noise.

860
00:51:52,428 --> 00:51:54,478
It's true!
Thank you, thank you.

861
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,430
That worked better than this afternoon.
You're a wonderful crowd.

862
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:58,900
My girl is so so dumb,

863
00:51:58,934 --> 00:52:01,368
she thought that iceberg
was a Yiddishe name.

864
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:03,367
(Praying)

865
00:52:03,402 --> 00:52:06,318
My girl is so dumb, she tried to
buy plum pudding from a plumber.

866
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:09,124
- All right, let's go.
- No, it's true.

867
00:52:09,158 --> 00:52:11,624
Had him running all over town.
Something else about my girl,

868
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:14,127
she was so dumb, they finally had
to burn down the schoolhouse

869
00:52:14,161 --> 00:52:16,412
to get her out
of the second grade.

870
00:52:16,445 --> 00:52:19,161
They let her pose
for the class photo,

871
00:52:19,212 --> 00:52:21,498
but oh boy, was she homely.

872
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:23,448
You've heard
of crocodile shoes?

873
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:26,134
Well, she had a pair...
with a complexion to match!

874
00:52:26,169 --> 00:52:28,386
- (Rimshot)
- I took her to visit the zoo.

875
00:52:28,422 --> 00:52:31,473
Why, the zookeeper thanked me
for bringing her back.

876
00:52:31,505 --> 00:52:33,390
Lovely family though...
very nice girl.

877
00:52:33,425 --> 00:52:36,341
Lovely family. Her poor father
died of throat trouble...

878
00:52:36,392 --> 00:52:38,677
they hung him.

879
00:52:40,261 --> 00:52:42,796
Her poor brother, lovely
chap, but he's gone too.

880
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:46,332
With good behavior, he should
be back in about 10 years.

881
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:50,136
He used to work in a bank, but no
matter how much the boss likes you,

882
00:52:50,154 --> 00:52:53,571
you can't work in a bank
and take home samples.

883
00:52:53,605 --> 00:52:54,855
Oh no!

884
00:52:54,907 --> 00:52:56,805
Pretty fucking obvious
now, ain't it?

885
00:52:56,823 --> 00:53:00,642
(Music plays)

886
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,494
- Okay!
- Get their guns.

887
00:53:02,528 --> 00:53:05,913
You're fucking dead.
You're fucking as good as dead!

888
00:53:05,947 --> 00:53:07,498
- All of youse!
- Shut your yap.

889
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:09,783
Easy easy, don't get rattled.

890
00:53:12,168 --> 00:53:13,951
(Owl hooting)

891
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:19,372
- (Branch cracks)
- What's that?

892
00:53:19,423 --> 00:53:20,925
What?

893
00:53:20,958 --> 00:53:23,542
- (Cracks)
- That!

894
00:53:23,594 --> 00:53:25,844
The fucking wind.
Relax.

895
00:53:30,164 --> 00:53:32,665
(Cracking)

896
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:41,339
(Agent shouts)

897
00:53:48,276 --> 00:53:50,778
The woods...
get him, get him!

898
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:53,231
Come here, you son of a bitch!

899
00:54:27,588 --> 00:54:29,722
(Sighs)

900
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:34,926
- (Clicks)
- What the?

901
00:54:46,103 --> 00:54:48,653
(Gunshot)

902
00:54:48,687 --> 00:54:51,021
Darmody!
Jimmy!

903
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,156
- Did you get him?
- Yeah.

904
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,491
- What the fuck was that?
- The fucking deers.

905
00:54:57,725 --> 00:55:00,111
Go on, get in the car.
Go on, scram!

906
00:55:02,897 --> 00:55:05,031
Come on, let's go.
Beat it.

907
00:55:13,121 --> 00:55:15,737
- (Tapping)
- [Man]: The court is now open.

908
00:55:15,757 --> 00:55:21,125
[Woman] ¶ well, good
morning, judge... ¶

909
00:55:21,175 --> 00:55:22,577
[Mr. Schröder]:
Got something to say now, huh?

910
00:55:22,595 --> 00:55:24,462
¶ I said
good morning, jury... ¶

911
00:55:24,513 --> 00:55:26,545
- You fucking whore!
- (Glass shatters, woman screams)

912
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:30,884
- ¶ I see you know my face, mmmmm,
mistaken surely... ¶ - (Thudding)

913
00:55:30,918 --> 00:55:33,436
- [Mrs. Schröder]: Please stop!
- ¶ When I see that sign ¶

914
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:36,384
- ¶ lord have mercy on my soul...
¶ - (Child wailing)

915
00:55:36,418 --> 00:55:40,223
- ¶ I couldn't budge, I hope to choke...
¶ - (Child screaming)

916
00:55:40,258 --> 00:55:44,309
¶ It was all a joke,
I said good morning, judge ¶

917
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,610
¶ you heard me,
good morning, judge... ¶

918
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:49,361
[Judge]:
Good morning, Sophie.

919
00:55:49,396 --> 00:55:52,397
- ¶ Good morning, jury... ¶
- Good morning.

920
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:54,983
(Sophie laughs)
When I see that,

921
00:55:55,034 --> 00:55:56,600
what that just said,

922
00:55:56,618 --> 00:55:59,570
- I can surely say...
- (Sobbing)

923
00:55:59,604 --> 00:56:01,937
¶ Oh lord ¶

924
00:56:01,954 --> 00:56:06,125
¶ lawd-a-mercy. ¶

925
00:56:13,214 --> 00:56:15,665
(music playing)

926
00:56:20,053 --> 00:56:22,336
I would love to get
married one day.

927
00:56:22,387 --> 00:56:26,057
I am very very sorry.
Excuse me

928
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,722
for one moment.

929
00:56:27,756 --> 00:56:29,958
- He is always talking on the phone.
- Hello.

930
00:56:29,975 --> 00:56:31,760
- [Sheriff]: It's me.
- What?

931
00:56:31,794 --> 00:56:35,228
It's me.
We got a problem.

932
00:56:39,299 --> 00:56:42,300
All right, I'll be right there.

933
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:43,519
(Shouting)

934
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,603
Fellas, fellas,
no leads or arrests.

935
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:50,022
- How many bodies were found?
- Nothing has been confirmed at this time.

936
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:52,991
As soon as we know something,
we'll make an official statement.

937
00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:55,494
Four bodies, blood everywhere.

938
00:56:55,528 --> 00:56:57,528
It was like a fucking
firing squad.

939
00:56:57,579 --> 00:56:59,532
No sign of the truck?

940
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:03,480
In a goddamned election year.

941
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:07,501
- The feds onto this yet?
- No.

942
00:57:07,535 --> 00:57:09,753
Hands still full
at the funeral home.

943
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:13,289
Cusick's probably
having a stroke.

944
00:57:13,322 --> 00:57:16,092
You know the imbecile
changed his name to Doyle?

945
00:57:17,343 --> 00:57:19,209
Don't ask.

946
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:24,547
You know,
the peculiar thing is...

947
00:57:24,597 --> 00:57:27,933
that at the same time
the feds are raiding Mickey,

948
00:57:27,967 --> 00:57:29,767
this shit...

949
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:31,768
is happening three miles away.

950
00:57:31,803 --> 00:57:34,022
Ain't that a coincidence?

951
00:57:37,775 --> 00:57:39,840
So do you want
to say it or should I?

952
00:57:41,841 --> 00:57:44,775
It could be Rothstein
himself set it up.

953
00:57:47,515 --> 00:57:49,784
All right, so who knew
about the load?

954
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,955
Jimmy?

955
00:58:00,658 --> 00:58:03,709
Who's mysteriously gone
missing all of a sudden.

956
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:08,696
All right, bring him in.

957
00:58:08,713 --> 00:58:11,565
(Music playing)

958
00:58:19,173 --> 00:58:21,370
Hey, Ange, I'm sorry.
I know it's late.

959
00:58:21,388 --> 00:58:23,058
Uh, Jimmy in?

960
00:58:23,091 --> 00:58:25,175
No, I haven't seen him
in hours.

961
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,008
I thought he was at work.

962
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,262
Sorry to disturb you.
When he comes home,

963
00:58:29,312 --> 00:58:31,181
tell him Nucky's
looking for him.

964
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:34,480
Well, now I'm getting
concerned.

965
00:58:34,514 --> 00:58:38,066
Probably ran into a friend...
war buddy maybe.

966
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,019
Do you think it could
have something

967
00:58:40,053 --> 00:58:42,020
to do with the men
that picked him up?

968
00:58:42,054 --> 00:58:44,371
Beg your pardon?

969
00:58:47,207 --> 00:58:48,891
There is no comment.

970
00:58:48,908 --> 00:58:50,659
Now you must stop ringing!

971
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,861
Cocksucking reporters.

972
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,861
If they want a statement,
tell them to call the Mayor.

973
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,530
Even reporters
ain't that stupid.

974
00:58:58,564 --> 00:59:00,116
I'll give them
a statement later.

975
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,086
I can't get over it.
It don't make sense.

976
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,402
- Doesn't it?
- Come on, Eli... Jimmy?

977
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,288
He gives the feds
the funeral home...

978
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:08,453
- (Phone ringing)
- Throws them off the scent.

979
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:10,455
Meantime he's out
pulling this job.

980
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:13,125
- Not how, why.
- Why? Because he's greedy.

981
00:59:13,176 --> 00:59:16,578
Jealous probably too.
That's the way people are, Nucky.

982
00:59:18,296 --> 00:59:20,263
Arnold Rothstein.

983
00:59:21,547 --> 00:59:24,682
I'm very sorry, Mr.
Thompson is not available.

984
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,271
He would very much like you
to call him back.

985
00:59:35,525 --> 00:59:37,561
- Where are you going?
- To get some air.

986
00:59:37,595 --> 00:59:40,443
(Music continues)

987
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:43,947
Mr. Thompson, I was just
coming to see you.

988
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:45,699
I'm sorry, I'm late
for a meeting.

989
00:59:45,733 --> 00:59:47,733
I really just wanted
to drop this off.

990
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:49,951
I'm on my way to the hospital.

991
00:59:49,985 --> 00:59:52,871
- Nothing serious, I hope?
- One of our members...

992
00:59:52,905 --> 00:59:55,905
Mrs. Schröder.
She... suffered an injury.

993
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,686
Lost her child.

994
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:02,641
What was the manner of injury?

995
01:00:04,023 --> 01:00:06,842
I'm really not
at liberty to say.

996
01:00:07,529 --> 01:00:10,196
¶ Into the dark oblivion where
there ain't no use a'living ¶

997
01:00:10,229 --> 01:00:12,399
¶ then you can lay me
low down in the ground ¶

998
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:18,233
¶ where not a soul
can get around ¶

999
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,570
¶ take away my cake,
take away my pie ¶

1000
01:00:21,657 --> 01:00:25,175
¶ take away my taste and even
take away my eyeball ¶

1001
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,226
¶ but Lordy ¶

1002
01:00:26,276 --> 01:00:28,276
¶ but Lordy, Mr. Man ¶

1003
01:00:28,294 --> 01:00:32,011
¶ now don't you take away
those blues. ¶

1004
01:00:33,409 --> 01:00:35,010
Commodore?

1005
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:37,126
Mr. Nucky
here to see you.

1006
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,700
Well, send him in,
for God's sake.

1007
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,356
Quite the shitstorm you got on
your hands, eh, Mr. Treasurer?

1008
01:00:52,391 --> 01:00:54,557
Well, good morning to you too.

1009
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:56,561
These bodies in the woods

1010
01:00:56,594 --> 01:00:59,478
I assume belong to your
friend in New York?

1011
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:01,529
(Sighs) Rothstein's men.

1012
01:01:01,563 --> 01:01:03,880
I don't understand
why you got involved.

1013
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:06,532
Yes you do!

1014
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:08,535
It was a favor to Chicago.

1015
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,735
That plus Rothstein's
numbers were right.

1016
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:12,655
Till he buggered you
in the ass.

1017
01:01:12,705 --> 01:01:15,489
Fucking Rothstein.

1018
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,157
(Grunts)

1019
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:19,609
By Henry fucking Ford.

1020
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:28,415
Oh, I think my problems
go beyond world finance.

1021
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:32,014
What a fucking night.

1022
01:01:38,587 --> 01:01:40,605
It's seven years today.

1023
01:01:43,692 --> 01:01:45,607
- Mabel.
- Oh.

1024
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:49,259
I'd just gone to jail.

1025
01:01:52,373 --> 01:01:54,439
Not a day goes by,
I'll tell you that much.

1026
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:57,341
Well, maybe she's better off.

1027
01:02:01,496 --> 01:02:03,446
The feds will be
all over this thing.

1028
01:02:03,464 --> 01:02:06,329
I can't have dead bodies lying around
on the road... bad for business.

1029
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,382
Well, you gotta
give them someone.

1030
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:10,835
Let 'em make an arrest.

1031
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,453
It's Jimmy.

1032
01:02:15,471 --> 01:02:17,506
Get the fuck...
This?!

1033
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,839
Left me holding the bag.

1034
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:22,059
What a fucking little prick.

1035
01:02:22,094 --> 01:02:25,146
I never knew he had it in him.

1036
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:27,511
Jimmy?

1037
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:32,318
Eh, fucking Jimmy.
(Laughs)

1038
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,235
Nucky.

1039
01:02:36,269 --> 01:02:38,934
Nuck!

1040
01:02:40,985 --> 01:02:42,171
- I take you back,
- Nucky,

1041
01:02:42,172 --> 01:02:43,572
- I give you a job...
- listen...

1042
01:02:43,605 --> 01:02:45,273
and this is how you
fucking repay me?!

1043
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:47,292
Last night was not supposed
to happen like that, Nuck.

1044
01:02:47,326 --> 01:02:49,710
Make sure you mention that to Rothstein
as he's cutting your nuts off.

1045
01:02:49,744 --> 01:02:51,660
That's all gonna get
straightened out, I promise.

1046
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,443
Are you that stupid?

1047
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:55,830
Have no fucking idea how
in over your head you are?

1048
01:02:55,881 --> 01:02:58,667
- I know it's awful...
- Did I not tell you to slow down?!

1049
01:02:58,718 --> 01:02:59,783
I tried to give you money.
I tried...

1050
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,301
I tried to tell you
I'm not a kid anymore!

1051
01:03:03,621 --> 01:03:05,872
And killing
and fucking larceny?

1052
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:09,091
- That makes you a man?
- No.

1053
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:12,609
(Sighs) You got brains, kid.

1054
01:03:12,643 --> 01:03:14,811
You had a future.

1055
01:03:14,862 --> 01:03:17,428
Look, I still got a future...
we both do.

1056
01:03:19,232 --> 01:03:22,535
The war, Nuck,
the things I did over there?

1057
01:03:22,568 --> 01:03:25,936
You live in a trench
for months on end.

1058
01:03:25,954 --> 01:03:28,938
The killing,
the smell of death...

1059
01:03:28,956 --> 01:03:31,439
Nucky, I'm nothing
but a murderer.

1060
01:03:31,457 --> 01:03:34,373
You know how many times
I went over the top?

1061
01:03:34,408 --> 01:03:36,626
They called me a fucking hero.
The truth is...

1062
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:39,277
I didn't care anymore.

1063
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:41,343
I didn't care.

1064
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,797
You're home now.

1065
01:03:44,815 --> 01:03:47,016
- You got a family.
- I'm going to hell, Nuck.

1066
01:03:47,066 --> 01:03:48,400
- Knock it off.
- No, I am.

1067
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:50,099
- You are not.
- I'm 22 years old.

1068
01:03:50,134 --> 01:03:53,268
I see fellas like fucking Luciano with
a fancy suit with fucking diamonds...

1069
01:03:53,302 --> 01:03:55,686
- is that what you want?
- That's what you want too!

1070
01:03:55,737 --> 01:03:58,239
That's what...
It's what we all want.

1071
01:03:58,273 --> 01:04:00,992
At least I got the gumption
to take it.

1072
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:05,361
You'd be very foolish
to underestimate me, James.

1073
01:04:05,412 --> 01:04:07,945
I could have you killed.

1074
01:04:09,414 --> 01:04:11,699
Yeah, but you won't.

1075
01:04:16,004 --> 01:04:19,256
Look, you can't be
half a gangster, Nucky.

1076
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,172
Not anymore.

1077
01:04:23,757 --> 01:04:25,175
Let me help you.

1078
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:28,545
What the fuck is this?

1079
01:04:28,596 --> 01:04:30,262
It's your share for last night.

1080
01:04:33,965 --> 01:04:35,999
I didn't ask for this.

1081
01:04:36,017 --> 01:04:38,202
You didn't have to.

1082
01:04:47,037 --> 01:04:49,657
¶ And as the night is falling ¶

1083
01:04:49,691 --> 01:04:52,458
¶ I find myself recalling ¶

1084
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:57,029
¶ that blissful
all-enthralling day ¶

1085
01:04:57,047 --> 01:05:00,632
¶ I found my love ¶

1086
01:05:00,665 --> 01:05:04,466
¶ in Avalon ¶

1087
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:09,335
¶ beside the bay ¶

1088
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:12,422
¶ I left my love ¶

1089
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:15,724
¶ in Avalon ¶

1090
01:05:15,757 --> 01:05:20,845
¶ and sailed away ¶

1091
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:24,599
¶ I dream of her ¶

1092
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:26,049
¶ in Avalon ¶

1093
01:05:27,815 --> 01:05:33,072
¶ from dusk till dawn ¶

1094
01:05:33,106 --> 01:05:36,355
¶ and so I think ¶

1095
01:05:36,389 --> 01:05:39,307
¶ I'll travel on ¶

1096
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:45,081
¶ to Avalon. ¶

1097
01:06:18,984 --> 01:06:20,518
(brakes squeal)

1098
01:06:21,771 --> 01:06:24,221
Sir, we need you to
come with us.

1099
01:06:24,238 --> 01:06:26,441
What're you doing?

1100
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,991
- What are you doing?
- Get in there!

1101
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,651
- (Singing in Italian)
- Sir!

1102
01:07:15,176 --> 01:07:17,257
You're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake.

1103
01:07:17,788 --> 01:07:19,103
(Grunts)

1104
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:25,703
(Singing continues)

1105
01:08:03,197 --> 01:08:05,960
- You get the gold?
- Are you kidding me?

1106
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:08,301
(Singing continues)

1107
01:08:09,102 --> 01:08:10,002
(Grunts)

1108
01:09:20,983 --> 01:09:23,460
(Crowd gasps)

1109
01:09:24,692 --> 01:09:26,826
[Reporter]: The Atlantic city
sheriff's department has confirmed...

1110
01:09:26,844 --> 01:09:29,771
that a body found caught in a
fisherman's net this afternoon...

1111
01:09:29,788 --> 01:09:33,534
is that of Hans Schröder, a local man
who went missing yesterday. Stop.

1112
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,022
Schröder, who worked
occasionally as a baker's helper,

1113
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:38,216
had been sought in connection
with Saturday night's...

1114
01:09:38,247 --> 01:09:40,572
bloody roadside massacre. Stop.

1115
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,391
[Cantor]: Maestro, can I have
my note, please? A note for Eddie?

1116
01:09:45,424 --> 01:09:47,707
¶ Ahhhh. ¶

1117
01:09:47,736 --> 01:09:49,974
This time it's a ballad.

1118
01:09:52,035 --> 01:09:54,639
¶ Jonesy used to roam ¶

1119
01:09:54,655 --> 01:09:56,458
¶ never stayed at home ¶

1120
01:09:56,476 --> 01:10:00,428
¶ he'd go out with the boys and
leave his wifey all alone ¶

1121
01:10:00,444 --> 01:10:04,445
¶ then the town went dry,
Jones began to cry ¶

1122
01:10:04,498 --> 01:10:08,664
¶ with no cafes or cabarets
I know I'll surely die ¶

1123
01:10:08,697 --> 01:10:10,864
¶ for weeks
it had him worried ¶

1124
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,924
¶ but now he's feeling gay ¶

1125
01:10:13,058 --> 01:10:14,942
¶ I heard him tell
a friend of his ¶

1126
01:10:15,018 --> 01:10:17,766
¶ out on the street
today, say! ¶

1127
01:10:17,801 --> 01:10:20,910
¶ I never knew
I had a wonderful wife ¶

1128
01:10:20,943 --> 01:10:25,211
¶ until the town went dry ¶

1129
01:10:25,242 --> 01:10:29,625
¶ the way I spent my money
on women was a crime ¶

1130
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,378
¶ I found that with my wife ¶

1131
01:10:31,413 --> 01:10:33,977
¶ I could have had
a better time ¶

1132
01:10:34,026 --> 01:10:36,046
¶ I'd send her to the country ¶

1133
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:38,095
¶ and I'd always shout hooray ¶

1134
01:10:38,115 --> 01:10:42,083
¶ but I saw her picture in a
bathing suit the other day ¶

1135
01:10:42,116 --> 01:10:45,588
¶ I never knew
I had a wonderful wife ¶

1136
01:10:45,639 --> 01:10:50,387
¶ until the town
went dry. ¶

1
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:51,903
Two more.

2
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,864
What do you say, Charlie?
Give me a hand here, huh?

3
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,706
- All right, roll it down. Easy now.
- You got it?

4
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,752
I got it, I got it.

5
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,339
Roll it down.

6
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,717
All right. Keep it going.

7
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,844
As far as I'm concerned,

8
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,096
they can take St. Patrick's Day
and sell it for scrap.

9
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,057
Dad says it's 'cause you hate being Irish.

10
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,809
I love being Irish.

11
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,186
What I hate is the yearly display
of crying, arguing,

12
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,021
and public drunkenness that goes with it.

13
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,024
Centuries of loss. We're a sorrowful people.

14
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,860
Maybe it'll snow.

15
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,615
Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

16
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,450
Good morning to you.

17
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,703
Would you care to order some breakfast?

18
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,621
No, Martin. Thank you.

19
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,836
Who am I, the Forgotten Man?

20
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,632
I beg your pardon, sir.
Would you like something?

21
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,301
No.

22
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,181
How come they ask you about breakfast
and I got to raise a stink?

23
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,600
I live here. It's a courtesy.

24
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,978
- You got to live here to get served?
- I'm a big tipper, Eli. Okay?

25
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,397
You act like it doesn't mean anything.

26
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,232
Because it doesn't.

27
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:59,155
The Celtic dinner, we're moving it up to 7:00.

28
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,573
Why so early?

29
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,533
The Civil War vets,

30
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,911
one of them snored over
the Attorney General's speech last year.

31
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,746
You don't got to be old for that to happen.

32
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,830
You think you can do better?

33
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,291
Actually, I was thinking about
saying a few words.

34
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,210
- What for?
- Some electioneering.

35
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,670
Those reformers are looking to replace me.

36
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,880
I don't think a speech is a good idea.

37
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,257
It's a captive audience of the
biggest pooh-bahs in the county, Nucky.

38
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,469
Who are there to celebrate their heritage,
not be bored by your palavering.

39
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,847
I've been practicing,
taking lessons at the YMCA.

40
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,605
It's an important night, Eli.

41
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,065
Bad enough I have Dad to look after.

42
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,650
I don't need you upsetting the apple cart, too.

43
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,360
I want to say my piece.

44
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,822
Fine. Daniel fucking Webster.

45
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:54,210
The widow Schroeder.

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,046
Mr. Thompson, good morning.

47
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,383
I was just on my way to your office.

48
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,136
Some soda bread.
I thought you might enjoy it.

49
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,098
It's from an old family recipe.

50
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,141
You can leave it with the bellhop.
He'll see that I get it.

51
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,604
I'm sure for your birthday
you received many fine gifts...

52
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,272
I'm late for a meeting, Mrs. Schroeder.

53
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,108
But thank you.

54
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,950
- Not a bad looking woman.
- My life's complicated enough.

55
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,675
Jesus! Did they even
wash these things from last year?

56
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,885
I was Baby New Year in '17.

57
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,512
Even the diaper was second-hand.

58
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,722
There's blood on this.

59
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,806
Captain Haddock's.

60
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,728
Some wiseacre tossed him off the Boardwalk.
He landed face first on an ashcan.

61
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,188
Fuck this.

62
00:05:56,273 --> 00:06:00,609
No more leprechauns, no more cupids,
no more goddamn elf costumes.

63
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,654
Kiley, Green, you're up.

64
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,950
- What's with you?
- I'm done, Carl.

65
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,828
We all are. No more midget shit.

66
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,247
Midget shit's what they're paying us for.

67
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,124
Not boxing. That's a show at least.

68
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,876
We're talking about this nonsense!

69
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,627
This fucking Celtic dinner.

70
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,337
It's degrading.

71
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,716
Yeah, not to mention having those drunk
assholes put their filthy mitts all over you.

72
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,843
What am I supposed to tell Nucky?

73
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,803
- He's depending on us.
- Yeah?

74
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,388
Let him wear a leprechaun getup.

75
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,390
See how he likes dancing around like a fool.

76
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,309
- Fuck him!
- Yeah.

77
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,397
What if I can get us a raise?

78
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,110
- How much?
- Double.

79
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,322
I'll tell him we want 10 bucks a man.

80
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,159
I might do it for $10.

81
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,662
10 clams for a few hours' work?

82
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,333
Where's my fucking shillelagh?

83
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,802
Making a mess of this.

84
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,806
That's okay. I like the smell.

85
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,850
Oranges in the winter? Huh?

86
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,936
From California?

87
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,063
Long trip.

88
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,190
A couple nights in a sleeper car,

89
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,400
and then you're there.

90
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,737
Wading up to your waist in the ocean.

91
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,534
I love you.

92
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,412
What was that?

93
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,541
Someone shut a door.

94
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,044
I'm not going to let anyone hurt you, Pearl.

95
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,633
Doc says you're doing good.

96
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,176
Does he?

97
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,262
But you got to leave it alone.

98
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,721
It itches.

99
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,015
That's good. It means it's healing.

100
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,560
Did your leg itch in the hospital?

101
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,520
For a while.

102
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,772
But not anymore?

103
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,109
No. Now it's hitting all six.

104
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,947
You're so handsome in your new suit.

105
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,786
Everything's going to turn out fine.

106
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,371
You'll see.

107
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,082
How about that? As fresh as it gets.

108
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,752
Any more laudanum?

109
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,174
What happened here?

110
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,259
Poof.

111
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,437
Don't be stingy.

112
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,647
It's opium, not a milkshake.

113
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,497
It's like the sun just came out.

114
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,804
Come on, George,
it's the busiest day of the year.

115
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,307
St. Paddy's or no, with Prohibition,

116
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,808
we're in uncharted territory.

117
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,937
So it's dead reckoning then.

118
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,563
To the Irish.

119
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,775
They drink when they're happy.
They drink when they're sad.

120
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,903
I drink to forget, but I can't remember what.

121
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,029
Well, it ain't just the micks.

122
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,532
My entire ward,
the speaks are packing 'em in every night.

123
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,576
Everybody wants
what they ain't allowed to have.

124
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,702
Psychology.

125
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,955
Whatever it is,
they can't keep the booze on the shelves.

126
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,122
Hidden under the shelves, you mean.

127
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,457
I'm going to need to up my order.

128
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,376
- You hearing this, Captain?
- I'm going to need an extra boat.

129
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,962
Hey, deal me in, will you?
- When do you shove off?

130
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,798
The stroke of midnight on the sea of green.

131
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,258
That from money or beer?

132
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,593
- How we fixed on that anyway?
- Green beer?

133
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,930
Food coloring came today.
They're dyeing it as we speak.

134
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,765
Make sure that dinner's supplied.

135
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,725
Going to need those poor Celts
well lubricated,

136
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,936
so they can get through
Eli's re-election speech.

137
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,646
- What speech?
- Didn't you hear?

138
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,022
He's Daniel Webster now.

139
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,233
- Yeah, you made that joke already.
- It's true!

140
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,402
He's taking Dale Carnagey lessons.

141
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,695
To the great orator.

142
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,405
Go on, give us a sample.

143
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,031
Fuck you. There's your sample.

144
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,951
Ah, the Irish, they're a surly lot.

145
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,202
Well, give him a drink.

146
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,412
Some green beer.

147
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,457
Yeah, well, in a couple of days
the town's going to be swimming in it.

148
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,460
They can drown for all I care,
so long as they pay.

149
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,423
And pay they will, Nucky,
through their pug Irish noses.

150
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:37,678
Oh, Nucky boy, the cash is coming

151
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:43,809
Right from their hands into your bank account

152
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,771
None of us was so naive as to believe

153
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,524
that Prohibition would end all drinking.

154
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,653
Mrs. Schroeder, how nice to see you again.

155
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,156
I was beginning to think you were ill.

156
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,659
No. Thank you for your concern.
I've been working.

157
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,494
Who's looking after your children?

158
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,996
A neighbor woman.

159
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,960
I've asked Bettyanne Mulhaney
to share with us

160
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,130
an incident related to her by a relative.

161
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,256
Mrs. Mulhaney?

162
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,842
I received a letter

163
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,637
from my cousin Martha in Nebraska.

164
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,557
One of her neighbors,
the widow of a dairy farmer,

165
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,101
had fallen on hard times.

166
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,194
"With six children to feed,
temptation got the better of her.

167
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,280
"So she decided
to mix up some gin in her bathtub,

168
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,450
"using a formula she'd gotten
from a farmhand.

169
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,244
"The idea being
they'd sell it in town for a profit."

170
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,662
The Devil's elixir.

171
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,039
- Yes, it is.
- Sinful.

172
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,123
- Devil.
- Sinful.

173
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,754
"She mixed some water with juniper berries
and denatured alcohol,

174
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,965
"let the mixture set
while she went off to fix supper.

175
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,052
"As she did,
her little one got in to the alcohol,

176
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,553
"poisoned herself dead."

177
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,599
Right here it's the same thing.
Illegal stills everywhere.

178
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,559
I passed by Ettinger's.

179
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,312
All those men at the counter
drinking from coffee cups.

180
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,439
Well, you know as well as I
it's not coffee at all.

181
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,899
Ettinger's isn't the only place.

182
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,234
There's Abe Klein's too.

183
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:21,490
It's clear. The local authorities lack the ability
or the inclination to enforce the law.

184
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,826
And with our numbers dwindling,

185
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,913
we have to work even harder
to capture their attention.

186
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,666
I heard Doc Holland
is writing prescriptions for whiskey.

187
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,084
You don't even have to be ill.

188
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,710
It's a disgrace is what it is.

189
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,712
Ladies, please.
With all this clatter

190
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,424
I'm not hearing what we might do about it.

191
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,427
A rally at the parade.
Get out there marching like the old days.

192
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,595
Marching is all well and good,

193
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,391
but we need to stop the alcohol at its source.

194
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,186
This morning I saw barrels of beer,
dozens of them,

195
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,189
being loaded into a garage behind my home.

196
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,066
This is what I'm talking about.

197
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,364
Perhaps Mr. Thompson could be of help.

198
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,866
The sheriff?

199
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,036
His brother, actually. Enoch. He's a friend.

200
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,545
Which is to say he's been of great assistance
since my husband passed.

201
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,505
Well,

202
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,383
perhaps you could arrange a meeting.

203
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,470
I'd be happy to try.

204
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,143
"Professional baseball
has reached a crisis.

205
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:35,981
"Charges of crookedness relating
to last year's World Series are emerging

206
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,734
"with a well-known New York gambler
at its center."

207
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,403
It doesn't mention you by name, does it?

208
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,489
It does everything but.

209
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,043
Speculation, innuendo,

210
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,546
and if I remember my law school Latin,

211
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,423
a steaming pile of horseshit.

212
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,843
Is that the legal term?

213
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,596
You had a meeting with some
washed-up ex-boxer.

214
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,806
- So what?
- Abe Attell.

215
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,559
Followed by a very public dinner

216
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,771
with Sleepy Bill Burns at the Astor Hotel.

217
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,773
Is it a crime now for a fellow to eat dinner?

218
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,733
The dinner was innocent, Counselor.

219
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,153
But for dessert
he pitched me on fixing the World Series

220
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,364
by bribing the players on the White Sox.

221
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,200
A scheme which you
threw cold water upon immediately.

222
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,247
Isn't that correct, Mr. Rothstein?

223
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,624
It certainly is.

224
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,460
Then, there you have it.

225
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,921
And what do I do about this article?

226
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,506
You do nothing, Arnold.

227
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,341
You get mud on your trousers...

228
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,093
Or horseshit?

229
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,471
Or horseshit. You don't rub it off.

230
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,767
You let it dry. You let it set a while.

231
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,728
Then you brush it off nice and easy.

232
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,403
The World Series was months ago,
Lawyer Fallon,

233
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,656
and the horseshit hasn't dried yet.

234
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,009
- Why are you hovering?
- Carl Heeley wants a word.

235
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:28,969
Who?

236
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,930
What does he want?

237
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,350
Just a quick tête-à-tête.

238
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,278
How's your dad?
Will he be at the dinner this year?

239
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,738
Can we just skip to the "by the way"?

240
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,532
- Beg pardon?
- Every day people come in here, Carl.

241
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:54,828
Dozens of them. They ask after my health,
my family, my goddamn goldfish.

242
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,747
Inevitably there's a "by the way."

243
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:57,873
Then they tell me what they really want.

244
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,833
- Well, that's not what I...
- Carl, I'm busy.

245
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,501
You'd be doing me a huge favor.

246
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,088
Me and the boys want a raise
to work the Celtic dinner.

247
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,214
Absolutely not.

248
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,969
Nucky, $5 a man is just not enough
for enduring that kind of humiliation.

249
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,555
Dancing a jig in a leprechaun outfit?
You call that humiliating?

250
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,308
- What do you call it?
- Show business.

251
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,935
You don't mind beating the tar
out of each other every night in that ring.

252
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,563
But these drunks are twice our size.

253
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,899
They get really rough
and they think it's funny.

254
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,485
How much do you want?

255
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,070
$10 a man.

256
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,072
What's that, $3 a foot?

257
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,990
It'll be a lot easier this year.

258
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,825
With Prohibition, there'll be no booze.

259
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,495
Come on, Nucky. I only look like a child.

260
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,336
Suppose I figure out a way
to give you an extra $12,

261
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,921
and I get to save $12 myself.

262
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,215
- I'm listening.
- There are eight leprechauns, right?

263
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,760
Eight times 10 is $80.
Tell your boys the best you can do is $7.

264
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,388
Then it'll cost me $56. I give you an extra $12.

265
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,806
That leaves me paying $68,

266
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,100
which is $12 less than
the $80 you originally wanted.

267
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,686
- I don't know, Nucky.
- Dinner starts at 7:00.

268
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,562
Tell your men
to be dressed and ready by 6:30.

269
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,195
I have another meeting waiting.

270
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,285
Hello, ladies.

271
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,914
Mr. Thompson,
thank you so much for seeing us.

272
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,499
Not at all.

273
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,378
Did you enjoy the soda bread?

274
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,462
Pardon?

275
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,132
Oh. Yes, very much. Thank you.

276
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,262
May I offer you something?

277
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,847
Thank you, no.

278
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:44,229
Mrs. Schroeder has seen something
she feels compelled to tell you about.

279
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,564
Oh?

280
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,734
Yesterday morning,

281
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:53,488
an entire truckload of beer barrels
was loaded into a garage behind my home.

282
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:59,161
A man who looked familiar,
but I couldn't really place him,

283
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,705
was supervising the delivery.

284
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,999
Why, that's outrageous.

285
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,710
I saw it with my own eyes.

286
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,086
I'm sure you must have been appalled.

287
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,380
I was, quite.

288
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:16,219
I'm afraid my birthday party
must have been quite difficult for you,

289
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,556
at Babette's, the nightclub.

290
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,559
I was making a delivery for the dress shop.

291
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,644
It was quite a celebratory atmosphere.

292
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,272
Some champagne and whiskey
may have even been drunk.

293
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,151
I'm sure your class of acquaintance
drinks only in moderation.

294
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,028
If they drink at all.

295
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,531
Mrs. Schroeder,
thank you for sharing this information.

296
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,366
Eddie, get the sheriff on the phone.

297
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,410
You give the details to my brother,

298
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,497
and we'll shut down that garage
before the tide goes out.

299
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,043
Mr. Thompson, we are grateful as always.

300
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,129
I truly do appreciate it.

301
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,882
This isn't a personal favor, Mrs. Schroeder.

302
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,220
Yes, I realize that.

303
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,272
Mmm-mmm.

304
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,150
Come on, eat a little.
You can't live on laudanum.

305
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,652
Watch me.

306
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,749
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey, hon.

307
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,584
How you feeling?

308
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,294
Swell.

309
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,933
Jesus Christ! She's fuckin' ruined.

310
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,811
Come on, it's not that bad.

311
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,438
If she was a filly, they'd shoot her.

312
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,110
I know you took a shine to her,
but she gotta go.

313
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,114
She hasn't even had her stitches out.

314
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,117
This is a cathouse, not the Hotel Sherman.

315
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,786
She don't earn, I don't earn.

316
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,166
What if I cover it?

317
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,501
$100 a day?

318
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,462
- She makes that much?
- She did.

319
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,135
She got till Friday.

320
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,363
So what did he want?

321
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,158
Nothing.

322
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,952
Scalcione's out sick.

323
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,455
He wants me to work the door.

324
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,092
I'll take the soup now.

325
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,137
Come on, bring it back, bring it back.

326
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,181
A little more, a little more.

327
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,308
All right, good. Stop, stop!

328
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,352
Go ahead.

329
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,812
Easy! It's going to fall on me.

330
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,773
I got it, I got it.

331
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,442
Now let's start unloading. Come on, guys.

332
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,860
All right, one at a time.

333
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,153
All right, coming down, coming down.

334
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,364
Come on,
don't get ahead of yourselves.

335
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,659
Good, good. Ma'am?

336
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,787
What are you doing?

337
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,455
We're unloading this truck.

338
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,040
Unloading it?

339
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,000
We got to tint it green by tomorrow.

340
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,086
For St. Paddy's.

341
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,797
Who is in charge here?

342
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,799
Boss?

343
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,265
Mrs. Schroeder, right?

344
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,934
Mr. Neary.

345
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,688
Like a soft night in Wicklow, isn't it?

346
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,815
I couldn't say. I'm from Kerry.

347
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:57,983
Ah.

348
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,235
The lofty peak of Carrauntoohil.

349
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,698
Did Mr. Thompson not speak with you today?

350
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:05,824
About what?

351
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,242
Your business here.

352
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,955
We'll be out of your hair by tomorrow.
Most of this stuff is for the Celtic dinner.

353
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,666
Listen, fellas, you've got to keep it down.

354
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,002
People are trying to sleep here.

355
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,840
What say we pour you off a growler
for St. Paddy's? Hmm?

356
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,883
Compliments of the city?

357
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,561
Neary, my boy! Nice of you to join us.

358
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,619
I am terribly sorry.
Mr. Thompson is not available.

359
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,413
He knows I've been waiting.

360
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,792
He has some urgent business.

361
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:14,536
101 Arctic, 23 cases of bourbon,
eight cases rye.

362
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,752
316 Adriatic,
15 cases blended Scotch whiskey.

363
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,133
90 Baltic, 11 cases gin.

364
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,763
Mrs. Schroeder.

365
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,016
Good afternoon.

366
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,184
I'm intruding.

367
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,894
You are not.

368
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,981
This is my colleague, Agent Sebso.

369
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,316
Margaret Schroeder.

370
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,651
Ma'am.

371
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,120
Is the post office in charge of Prohibition?

372
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,164
No, ma'am.

373
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:07,422
You said I should come to you
if I had information.

374
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,845
Roll down your sleeves. Put on your jacket.
Bring Mrs. Schroeder a chair.

375
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,722
Go outside and block the entrance.

376
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,343
On the street behind my home is a garage.

377
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,428
Yes?

378
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,513
It's full of beer barrels.

379
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,642
How many?

380
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,102
Quite a large quantity.

381
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,647
Could you give me an estimate?

382
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,733
Ninety three?

383
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,279
What's the address?

384
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,698
2727 Caspian.

385
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,159
The Hiawatha Garage.

386
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,412
Right out in the open.

387
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,375
You will close it down, won't you?

388
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,670
When would you like me to do that?

389
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,257
Immediately. Children can see it.

390
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,514
There are now 117 pins here.

391
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,267
Each one marks a location in this city

392
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,436
where alcohol is being warehoused,
distilled, or sold.

393
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,813
They operate with impunity,

394
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:50,024
and I do not possess the resources
to shut even 10% of them.

395
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,027
I understand.

396
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:57,282
Then you'll also understand
that every one of these pins taken together

397
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,616
amounts to nothing.

398
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:03,538
Here on the south shore of Brigantine
and here in the back bays of the inlet,

399
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,710
boats unload liquor sailed down from Canada,
up from the Caribbean, across the Atlantic.

400
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,588
It is watered down, mixed with poisons,
and sold illicitly

401
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:17,343
by a growing class of criminals for whom
murder is a means of doing business.

402
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,806
Some of the victims
are no better than killers themselves.

403
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,391
Others are just unlucky.

404
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,728
They are shopkeepers, schoolteachers.

405
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,398
One was a baker's apprentice.

406
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,403
Do you mean to be cruel, Mr. Van Alden?

407
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,074
No, ma'am. I mean to be honest.

408
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,203
And what of the law that creates the criminal?

409
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,373
That's the law you've just asked me to enforce

410
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,251
for the safety of your children.

411
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,547
Unless I misread your intentions.

412
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,929
I've been lectured to a great deal today
by men who speak boldly and do nothing.

413
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,437
- I'd like to leave now.
- Who else lectured you?

414
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,730
Why should that be your concern?

415
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,899
Because you don't want to tell me.

416
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,818
Will you arrest me in the post office?

417
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,613
Not unless you've committed a crime.

418
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,575
Mr. Neary.

419
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,287
Mr. Neary lectured you?

420
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,831
Mr. Neary owns the garage.

421
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,963
James Neary,
the alderman from the fourth ward?

422
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,465
I don't know his first name.

423
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,258
What do you know about him?

424
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,179
He works for Mr. Thompson.

425
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,061
Now they're frisking people?
After they already shot up the joint?

426
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,229
Better late than never.

427
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,233
It's like the horse after the barn door in here.

428
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,484
After the horse.

429
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,944
What?

430
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,696
You close the barn door
after the horses are gone.

431
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,532
- That's the expression.
- That's what I said.

432
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,242
No, you said...

433
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,910
Look, it doesn't matter.

434
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,288
Fuck the horse. Torrio don't like headaches.

435
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,833
I think he's already got one.

436
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,379
Those mick bastards,
we should hit them tomorrow.

437
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,090
And they'll be soused off their asses
for St. Paddy's.

438
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,550
Is that what Torrio wants?

439
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,261
You start worrying about
what other people want,

440
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,971
you'll go batty.

441
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,019
What happened to her?

442
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,229
Hi, boys.

443
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,607
Who wants to buy me a drink?

444
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,069
Pearl, what are you doing?

445
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,779
I'm working.

446
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,322
I got to earn my keep.

447
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,866
You don't have to work today, honey.

448
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,951
Go on, get her out of here.

449
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,997
Come on, let's go upstairs.

450
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,498
I need more juice.

451
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,834
I'm going to make you some right now, okay?

452
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,878
What's so funny?

453
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,338
Nothing. Someone told a joke.

454
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,674
Jimmy?

455
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,260
What, sweetie? What? What?

456
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,429
Who's going to love me now?

457
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:20,109
Relax, dear.
It's the best thing when they're overtired.

458
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,903
You should have asked me.

459
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,615
When James was that age he used to
work himself into such an impossible state.

460
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,784
Whiskey and milk were a godsend.

461
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,955
Do you think she's attractive?

462
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,167
I don't have much time for movies right now.

463
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,085
I remember how that was.

464
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,714
Of course, I used to have the girls around
to help babysit.

465
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,592
Jimmy never wanted for feminine attention.

466
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,348
I have to meet my friend. She's waiting.

467
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,142
Well, see a movie, dear.

468
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:56,270
We're going to take some air
on the Boardwalk.

469
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,773
The night before St. Patrick's?

470
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,108
There tends to be a lower element abroad.

471
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,945
We'll be very careful.

472
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,781
I'm sure you will be.

473
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,289
You could be free, you know?

474
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,208
Beg pardon?

475
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:22,296
You're an attractive girl with artistic leanings.

476
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,882
The painting and all.

477
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,429
Waiting for a man you're not married to,
who may never return.

478
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,683
I have a child.

479
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,935
I'll raise him.

480
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
What?

481
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:42,108
You go off, have your youthful adventures

482
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,735
and I'll raise Tommy.

483
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,821
You'll raise my son?

484
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,533
Think about it.

485
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,577
Talk it over with your friend.

486
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,995
I don't need to think about it.

487
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,163
What kind of thing is that to say?

488
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,041
I didn't mean to offend you.

489
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:03,671
I just assumed that you'd be open
to a different sort of arrangement,

490
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,881
bohemian that you are.

491
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,134
I'm not open to it at all.

492
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,178
Well, the more fool, I.

493
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:24,442
No need to keep your friend waiting.

494
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:37,079
I wish I was

495
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:41,125
In Carrickfergus

496
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:45,296
Only for nights

497
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,050
In Ballygran

498
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:53,596
I would swim over

499
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:01,646
The deepest ocean

500
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,067
For my love to find

501
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:10,237
But the sea is wide

502
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,157
And I cannot swim over

503
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,701
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know.

504
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,204
- What?
- Ddd, Carrickfergus.

505
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,872
Oh, what do I give a shit?

506
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:25,002
...I wings to fly

507
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:29,423
If I could find me

508
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:33,177
A handsome boatman

509
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,096
Where the hell were you?

510
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,515
The boys were using my sash to play Tarzan.

511
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,058
Where were you?

512
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,601
Every year with this.

513
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:46,273
For I'm drunk today

514
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:51,195
And I'm seldom sober

515
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,281
A handsome rover

516
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:58,953
From town to town

517
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:03,165
Ah, but I'm sick now

518
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:08,129
My days are numbered

519
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:13,134
So come all ye young men

520
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:20,516
And lay me down

521
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,646
Duncan O'Connor, everybody!

522
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,356
Bravo!

523
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,985
Thank you, Mayor Bacharach.

524
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,530
God bless America
and God bless the Emerald Isle.

525
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,325
Fellow members
of the ancient order of the Celts,

526
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:42,580
welcome, one and all,
to our annual St. Patrick's Eve dinner.

527
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:46,417
As is our custom,
I'd like to turn over the festivities

528
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,003
to Atlantic County's esteemed Treasurer,

529
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,006
that proud Irishman, Enoch Thompson.

530
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,135
When do I get to talk?

531
00:34:56,553 --> 00:35:00,139
They're here to enjoy themselves.
Is it really necessary?

532
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,018
Hear, hear, Nucky!

533
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,436
Good evening, gentlemen.

534
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:10,524
This being an election year,
with your kind indulgence,

535
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,277
Sheriff Eli Thompson has asked
to say a few words before we get started.

536
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,489
So this one's going to talk now?

537
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,497
Thank you, Enoch, Mr. Mayor.

538
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,252
Have a drink.

539
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,424
Your hands are shaking.

540
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:43,265
Friends, Romans, and Irishmen...

541
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,643
Lend me your beers!

542
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:52,525
Tomorrow we will celebrate our patron saint,
the beloved St. Patrick,

543
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,693
he what drove the snakes out of Ireland.

544
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:55,778
- That's right!
- Hear, hear!

545
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,405
Today I submit for your approval

546
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,866
that he should have drove the English out!

547
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,284
Yeah!

548
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,161
My friends,

549
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,998
it wasn't a famine of nature
that killed our forefathers.

550
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,835
It was a famine by Cromwell!

551
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,211
- Hear, hear!
- That's right!

552
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,671
And now,

553
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:18,133
in our own time
the murdering Brits are at it again,

554
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:22,346
slaughtering the heroes of the
eastern rebellion in Kilmainham Gaol!

555
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,808
- Pearse and MacDonagh!
- That's right!

556
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,852
Eamonn Ceannt and Jonah Clarke!

557
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,520
Thomas, you idiot.

558
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,605
What's he know? He was born in the States.

559
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,108
Of course. Yes, Thomas.

560
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,901
You speculating that those of us born here

561
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,862
are less committed
to the troubles back home?

562
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,114
I'm saying I've seen things
with my own eyes in Dublin.

563
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,033
By what right do the English
suppress our brothers across the ocean?

564
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:46,537
My district alone
raised over $2,000 for the fight.

565
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,290
I held a fucking line against the Brits
with nothing more than a fire poker.

566
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,708
It's my sons who are fighting and dying.

567
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,042
With arms we provided.

568
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,711
- Up the rebels!
- Up your asses!

569
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,754
By no right at all, gentlemen...

570
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,049
You're going to have
a fucking riot on your hands.

571
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,344
...our brothers across the country!
- Say that again!

572
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,348
Gentlemen, we here in the United States, we...

573
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,142
Sheriff Eli Thompson, everybody!

574
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,689
You remember that.

575
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,317
So sit down!

576
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,988
What do you call an Irishman
who doesn't swear?

577
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,072
A mute.

578
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,284
What do you call an Irishman
who doesn't drink?

579
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,660
A corpse.

580
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,705
What do you call an Irishman
from Atlantic City?

581
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,333
It doesn't matter where he's from.
You call him an Irishman!

582
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,252
Erin Go Bragh!

583
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,630
Now let me hear those pipes.

584
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:43,844
The little people.

585
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,263
They've been to the end of the rainbow,

586
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,599
and they're here with the pots of gold.

587
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,704
Where's the green beer?

588
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,247
Not this year, Assemblyman.

589
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:14,208
But it's a goddamn tradition.

590
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,668
The Feds found our stash.

591
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,720
You got to go easy
on this stuff, okay?

592
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:30,265
- Bad girl.
- Not bad, just go easy.

593
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,894
We should go down to Chinatown for a bowl.

594
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,688
What did I just say?

595
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,774
But it's so much better when you smoke it.

596
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,651
Palm trees and sunshine.

597
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,695
We'll do that, I promise.

598
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,740
Tell me a story.

599
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,536
- About what?
- You.

600
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,539
- Something happy.
- Uh...

601
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,582
Okay.

602
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,462
Well. I was... What, seven?

603
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,755
What'd you look like?

604
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,258
Like I do now. Smaller.

605
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,510
Hair down to here.

606
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,554
- No.
- Yeah.

607
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,975
My mother thought it looked aristocratic.

608
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,105
Everyone else just thought I was a girl.

609
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,738
Anyway, there was this man, Mr. Lancaster.

610
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,573
He was worth a few dollars,

611
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:30,951
so my mother figured
she could get him to marry her.

612
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,953
He had a sailboat.

613
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,830
Make it a yacht.

614
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,124
Sure, a yacht.

615
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:45,215
On the 4th of July,
he took us boating, my mother and me.

616
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:50,429
She was in a white tea dress
and a Merry Widow hat.

617
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,513
Mmm.

618
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,848
She was beautiful.

619
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,767
She was. She still is.

620
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,522
We sailed past the lighthouse
up along to Brigantine,

621
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,983
where the pirates used to hide.

622
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:07,488
Mr. Lancaster showed me
how to use the mainsheet,

623
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,573
put me at the tiller.

624
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:13,827
I steered us into Little Egg Inlet
like I'd done it my whole life.

625
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,831
We tied up at Egg Island.

626
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,709
We went ashore.

627
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,257
My mother told me to go away for a while.
I was used to that.

628
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,720
So I ran around pretending to be a pirate.

629
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,726
And when it was okay to come back,
Mr. Lancaster dug a pit in the sand,

630
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:42,981
loaded in some coals to roast the lobster
and the corn he had brought,

631
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,610
and we just ate like kings.

632
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,742
When the sun began to set,

633
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,996
Mr. Lancaster told me
to go get this box from the boat.

634
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,499
"And be very careful."

635
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:07,297
Inside was stars and stripes he said
that his father had carried at Gettysburg,

636
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:11,009
which had to be true 'cause
there were bullet holes on it.

637
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:15,639
So we stuck the flagpole in the grass,

638
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,308
and we sang.

639
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,271
My country, 'tis of thee...

640
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:29,903
With our hands on our hearts,

641
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:33,866
we watched the fireworks go off
all the way down the Boardwalk.

642
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,453
We sailed home under the moon.

643
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,957
My mother was combing the sand
out of my hair.

644
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,628
That was a good day.

645
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,927
Tell me he married her.

646
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,598
Sure, he did.

647
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,268
Happily ever after.

648
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,318
Shit! God damn it.

649
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,530
Somebody's going to really have to
take care of you.

650
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,284
I should wash this.

651
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,621
Kiss me.

652
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,767
Get yourself cleaned up, lover.

653
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:49,543
Thank you. It's great to see you again.

654
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,381
There's a time and place, Eli.
You have to know your audience.

655
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,133
Give them what they want, huh, Nuck?

656
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,010
Isn't that what your book says?

657
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,053
The Dale Carnagey?

658
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,434
- Why don't you take a break?
- Why?

659
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,269
Because I'm trying
to help you and you're drunk.

660
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,562
And you're not?

661
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:10,939
Oh, that's right.

662
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,027
This is the one night of the year
you don't drink.

663
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:19,323
These men, Eli,
these kingmakers you wanted to impress?

664
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:22,659
You may not think so,
but they're judging you every second.

665
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:25,329
And when something good comes along,
an opportunity,

666
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,664
they remember the man
who showed good form.

667
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,709
The whole thing's a game, isn't it?

668
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,588
It's so easy for you.

669
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,095
Well, I'll keep at it.

670
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,473
Maybe one day I'll lie as good as you.

671
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,268
It's "Lie as well as me," you dolt.

672
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:52,105
You want to be taken seriously?
Then learn how to fucking speak.

673
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,777
So the leprechaun looks up at the blonde
and says,

674
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:01,782
"It may be yellow, lady,
but it's sure no pot of gold."

675
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,371
Nobody move!
United States Bureau of Internal Revenue!

676
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,455
This is a private party!

677
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,956
This is a raid.

678
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,459
- What the hell is this now?
- Easy, Dad.

679
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:17,547
Do you have any idea who these men are?

680
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,174
This is a private party,

681
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,760
and the mere consumption
of alcohol is not illegal.

682
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:25,305
Now I'm an attorney,
and the Volstead Act clearly...

683
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:34,439
Would anyone else care to interfere with
the court-appointed duties of a federal agent?

684
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,069
Stand down.

685
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:44,658
Anybody tries to make a run for it,
shoot them.

686
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,009
I have an arrest warrant.

687
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,891
James Neary

688
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:13,895
of 1222 Chelsea Avenue,
Atlantic City, New Jersey?

689
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,898
You are Mr. James Neary?

690
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,733
Yeah.

691
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,278
I have witness testimony that you knowingly

692
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:25,073
and willingly stored and transported
intoxicating liquors.

693
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,492
A direct violation of the Volstead Act.

694
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,744
- No, I don't know what your...
- Stand up!

695
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,663
You're under arrest.

696
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,805
This assembly is over.

697
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,641
This establishment will be shuttered.

698
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:56,313
Gather your belongings and disperse
in an orderly fashion.

699
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,399
Mr. Neary, how much liquor?

700
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:00,817
Is there anything you want to say?

701
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,694
- Just one more picture.
- Was he selling alcohol?

702
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,654
- Who else is in there?
- How many are being arrested?

703
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,490
Any comment, Mr. Ward Boss?

704
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:10,285
All ye who love your country

705
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:14,247
Against the drink should stand

706
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:18,084
Behold against this traffic

707
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,254
Your country's greatest foe...

708
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,465
You going to do something about this,
Sheriff?

709
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,259
Let word and deed and ballot

710
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,971
Proclaim that drink must go

711
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:34,726
Stand up for Prohibition

712
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,396
Ye patriots of the land...

713
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:39,481
Let's go.

714
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,525
All ye who love your country...

715
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,818
Go home to your families!

716
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:45,320
Bugger off, you harridans!

717
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:46,905
Disperse, all of you.

718
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,867
Behold against this traffic

719
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:54,621
Your country's greatest foe

720
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,040
- Lock it up.
- Move along.

721
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,546
Proclaim that drink must go

722
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:06,883
Stand up for Prohibition

723
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:10,929
Ye soldiers of the Lord

724
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,390
Put on the gospel armor

725
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:16,142
Great night for the Irish, big brother.

726
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,105
I'm sure you made quite an impression
among your Republican friends.

727
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,815
Go home to your wife, Eli.

728
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,733
I will.

729
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,570
Where are you going?

730
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,992
What the fuck was that for?

731
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,844
Who is it?

732
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,846
Nucky Thompson.

733
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,480
Mr. Thompson?

734
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,284
Is there something you wanted?

735
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:23,037
I've no time for games, Margaret.
No interest in them.

736
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:27,834
Margaret?

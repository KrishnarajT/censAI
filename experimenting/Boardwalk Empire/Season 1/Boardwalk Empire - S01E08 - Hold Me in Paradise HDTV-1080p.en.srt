1
00:00:01,529 --> 00:00:03,131
What do you want from him?

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,534
I don't want to lose this.

3
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:07,638
- Do you love him?
- I'm fond of him.

4
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:09,442
Why won't you return my calls?

5
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,712
What does she have
that I don't have?

6
00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:13,749
- She's a shop girl.
- We'll talk about it later.

7
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:15,920
How many times you think
you can knock over

8
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:17,991
Nucky Thompson's bagman
before he bites back?

9
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:19,493
You been to Lolly Steinman's?

10
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:22,797
End of a Saturday they got
150 grand in the cage.

11
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:24,935
May I present
Senator Walter Edge

12
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:27,773
and the honorable Frank Hague,
Mayor of Jersey City.

13
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:29,174
I want the highway.

14
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,344
You're putting a big bet
on Walter Edge.

15
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,483
I wouldn't. He's a silent
partner in a paving company.

16
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:37,554
- Where?
- Jersey City, where your roads aren't.

17
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:40,927
Nucky Thompson didn't get
where he is by being naive.

18
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:42,696
He could stop giving me money.

19
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,198
What about Jimmy?

20
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:46,035
I would have thought
he'd send something...

21
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:48,071
if not for me, for Tommy.

22
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:50,541
He's a genius, this kid.

23
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:52,410
They'd come
after us eventually.

24
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:55,014
Us? So you're
sticking around.

25
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:59,087
I could use a dozen like you.

26
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,491
The World Series was
months ago, lawyer Fallon.

27
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:04,428
And the horse shit
hasn't dried yet.

28
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:06,597
Do you have children
of your own, Mr. Thompson?

29
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:08,434
I do not.

30
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,871
Go home, Nelson.
Visit your wife.

31
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,340
That's an order.

32
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:14,208
The whole thing's
a game, isn't it?

33
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:17,914
So easy for you.
Well, I'll keep at it.

34
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:19,683
Maybe one day
I'll lie as good as you.

35
00:01:19,718 --> 00:01:22,253
It's lie as well as me,
you dolt.

36
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:25,191
Want to be taken seriously?
Then learn how to speak.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,074
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

38
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:41,034

39
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,384
Well, who was it?

40
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:53,686
Fella got off on the wrong floor.
He was drunk.

41
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:56,422
The General Motors Convention.

42
00:03:56,457 --> 00:03:59,325
That's it?
There's nobody else out there?

43
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:04,229
That waiting room's packed
when Nucky's in town.

44
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:09,066
I don't get it. It's not like
the city's closed for business.

45
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,068
When he's away, I'm in charge.
What's so complicated?

46
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:15,438
People are funny...
creatures of habit.

47
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:18,406
They need a favor, they know
Nucky's the man to see.

48
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,978
Get me some coffee.

49
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:30,518
You don't think
I can do what he does?

50
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,651
The glad-handing,
the backslapping?

51
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:35,086
I'll buy a nickel joke book
down at the five and dime,

52
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:37,555
I'll be the toast
of the town myself.

53
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:47,195
- Oh.
- Oh what?

54
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,532
I forgot!
Nuck's in Chicago.

55
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,534
And I'm here,
so what do you want?

56
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,606
This Friday

57
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:02,275
my daughter's being
fitted for her leg braces.

58
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:04,477
I-I was hoping
to take the day,

59
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:06,779
have someone else
make my collections.

60
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:08,848
- Who usually fills in?
- Neary,

61
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:11,016
but with the indictment,

62
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,884
I got his route now too.

63
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:14,553
Your kid has polio?

64
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:19,757
Take the day off.
Be with your girl.

65
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,792
Are you sure?

66
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:24,760
I just said it, didn't I?
Why would I not be sure?

67
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:27,896
Thanks.

68
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:38,806
- Good day, sir.
- Here you go.

69
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,307
Thank you, sir.

70
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:43,777
My wire specifically requested
the presidential suite.

71
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:46,714
I'm sorry, sir.
General Wood has also made that request.

72
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:49,216
- He's jumping the gun a bit, isn't he?
- Sir?

73
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,985
General Wood is only
a candidate for president.

74
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,620
Oh yes, of course.

75
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,655
The ambassador suite is
quite lovely as well, sir.

76
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,389
Fine, then give Wood
the ambassador

77
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,991
- and bring my bags up to the presidential suite.
- Sir, I...

78
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,725
Let me tell you the difference
between me and General Wood.

79
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,528
He is a war hero,
former Army Chief of Staff

80
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:09,898
and practically a shoo-in for the
Republican presidential nomination.

81
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:12,900
I, on the other hand,
am a magnificent tipper.

82
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:16,269
I'd like a bucket of ice
and three bottles

83
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:18,437
of Canadian club
waiting in the parlor.

84
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:23,242
Please make yourself comfortable
while we prepare the suite.

85
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,318
All this empty space, I wonder
where they hide the hootch.

86
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:47,093
Well, if it isn't
Marley's ghost.

87
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:50,495
Senator Edge, whatever
brings you to Chicago?

88
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,364
Oh, I don't know.

89
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:55,133
I heard the Republicans were
throwing a little shindig,

90
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,468
- thought I'd drop by.
- Grab the V.P. nod while you're here?

91
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:01,305
I hadn't actually
considered that,

92
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,539
but now that you mention it...

93
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,711
- How are you, Nuck?
- Well, I can't complain,

94
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:10,578
but that doesn't mean I won't.

95
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:12,814
I'm wondering if you'd
do me a favor.

96
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:17,218
Harry Daugherty's hosting a reception
tonight, he asked me to drop by.

97
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,553
Warren Harding's
campaign manager?

98
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:22,322
- Who cares about Harding?
- Well, nobody,

99
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:24,658
but Daugherty's
a good man to know.

100
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:28,294
If you'd go on my behalf?
I have a pressing engagement.

101
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:30,596
Well, don't press on her
too hard, Walter.

102
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:34,832
You know me well, my friend.

103
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:37,135
I do indeed.

104
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:42,005
We're gonna take
this thing, Nucky.

105
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,009
And as soon as we do,
the sky's the limit.

106
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:48,178
The sky?
I'm only interested

107
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:50,679
in the roads,
Mr. Vice President.

108
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:56,117
- So you'll see Daugherty?
- You know me... I'll see 'em all.

109
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:58,886
You're a real pal, Nuck.

110
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:01,956
- Gentlemen.
- Ah!

111
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,357
The Senator seems
in a good humor.

112
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:06,793
Go check on the room.

113
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:18,970
- Peridot.
- Is that what it's called?

114
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:20,805
Not emeralds, but not nothing.

115
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,440
Do you think he
picked it himself?

116
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:25,076
I don't know.

117
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,611
Either he's got better taste in women's
jewelry than a red-blooded man should,

118
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:32,316
- or someone's doing his shopping for him.
- Mr. Kessler, perhaps.

119
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:34,184
- The little bochey fellow?
- Mm-hmm.

120
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:36,753
What's he got hidden
under his woolens?

121
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:39,222
The kaiser's mustache.

122
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:42,358
You are a terrible influence.

123
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,761
How is your Harry?

124
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:47,463
My Harry's fine.
How's yours?

125
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:50,965
We should
get some more cream cakes.

126
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:54,068
Oh, why not? We can bring
them back for the children.

127
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:58,572
- Not so bad sometimes, is it?
- What?

128
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:01,541
The whole ball of wax.

129
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,278
- Margaret.
- Madame Jeunet.

130
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,115
Oh, you must assist me.

131
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,051
- In what?
- Where'd you go?!

132
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,186
Ahhh.

133
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,955
Everybody knows
everybody, isn't that swell?

134
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,258
- How's tricks, Lucy?
- Don't act like you care.

135
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:24,227
She wishes to make a large
purchase, but her credit...

136
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:26,463
Mr. Thompson has made clear
that he no longer...

137
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:29,331
What are you two
whispering about?

138
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:31,767
Americans don't whisper.

139
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,636
I have asked Margaret
to help me to explain...

140
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,138
Oh, she'll help.
She's very helpful.

141
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:39,406
Aren't you,
Mrs. MacDougal?

142
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:43,909
- Schroeder.
- Is that Irish for "bitch"?

143
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:49,080
You're not at your best now
and you should leave.

144
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:51,482
Oh, you're in charge
of the lobby now too?

145
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:54,285
- Lucy.
- My old friend Annabelle.

146
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,355
You wouldn't steer
me wrong, would you?

147
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,126
- No, I wouldn't.
- You're about as phony as that wig.

148
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:03,763
Miss Danziger,
you must stop now.

149
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:05,697
You think that
he's your friend?

150
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,634
You think you understand him?

151
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:10,903
And what if I did?

152
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:13,671
Then you're the dumbest Dora
I ever met.

153
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:22,079
The next time won't be
nearly as pleasant.

154
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:42,497
What do you think?

155
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:45,198
She looks pretty.

156
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:55,164
The grocery bill...
it's overdue.

157
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:58,166
- How much is it?
- Nearly $11, dear.

158
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:02,004
Hello, Tommy.

159
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,638
Did you check the box?

160
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:05,706
I saw the postman as well.

161
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,609
There was nothing else.

162
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,618
Perhaps it's time
you get a job.

163
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:22,254
My friend Mary
said the same thing.

164
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:25,290
Have you considered
selling Little Dot?

165
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:28,726
- I'm not sure what that is.
- It's a perfume company.

166
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,162
The ladies who go door to door?

167
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:34,131
Some of their fragrances
are really quite lovely.

168
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,534
The Violet, Lily of the Valley.

169
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:39,369
I don't think it's for me.

170
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:41,704
That's right,

171
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:44,206
you bohemian types
go au naturel.

172
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,176
I've worn perfume.

173
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,179
I was talking about the job.

174
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:56,050
There's an art dealer
in New York...

175
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:58,352
Greenwich Village...

176
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:01,554
and he's agreed
to look at my work

177
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,790
with an eye
toward selling it.

178
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:07,225
- Oh really?
- There are no guarantees, of course.

179
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,662
- But Mary...
- Your friend.

180
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,032
Yes.

181
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:17,701
She thinks I have
a good chance.

182
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:22,905
You could take a stenography
course as well, you know.

183
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:32,914
- Sir?
- Yes?

184
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:35,083
We got another one.

185
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:12,081
I haven't confirmed it yet,

186
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:14,649
but word on the street
is the D.A.

187
00:13:14,684 --> 00:13:17,018
is sniffing around
some of the White Sox.

188
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:21,890
Then he'd be wise to put
a clothespin on his nose.

189
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,126
Any idea which players?

190
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:30,730
Cicotte and Jackson,
near as I can tell.

191
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:33,199
Get the farm boys to spill
their milk, is that the idea?

192
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:37,469
Fallon & McGee.
How may I help you?

193
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:41,806
It doesn't matter what they
say if Attell won't talk.

194
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:44,776
Will he?

195
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,547
He's already been
flapping his gums.

196
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,484
And if the D.A.
pulls him in?

197
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,753
He may be able to take a punch,

198
00:13:57,787 --> 00:14:01,888
but put him in a witness chair and 
Abe Attell will fold like hot laundry.

199
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:06,826
Give it to me again.

200
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,994
"Baseball is the heart of America.

201
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,164
As a patriot,
I would never do anything

202
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,399
- to degrade our..."
- Besmirch.

203
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:19,303
It's better.

204
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:25,106
"... To 'besmirch'
our national pastime.

205
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:29,845
Ladies and gentlemen,
this entire ugly affair

206
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,448
began when Abe Attell
and some other cheap gamblers

207
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:34,884
approached me to fix
the World Series,

208
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:37,386
a sordid scheme which
every newsboy on Broadway

209
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,054
knows I turned down flat.

210
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,223
And not only was I
not in on the deal,

211
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:45,226
I furthermore did not bet
one red cent on the Series

212
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,094
after I found out
what was underway."

213
00:14:47,128 --> 00:14:50,699
Isn't it true, sir, that a man named
Sport Sullivan approached you as well?

214
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:53,974
"I'm approached
by people every day

215
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:56,410
with all manner
of harebrained schemes.

216
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:58,545
Certainly suffering fools

217
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,880
can't be illegal."

218
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:06,652
You know it's not too late
to go to law school, Arnold.

219
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,891
I prefer to make
my living honestly.

220
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:19,196
- Never get close to a majority.
- Absolutely.

221
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,832
And with Coolidge on the
ticket, I think he has...

222
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,401
- Sir?
- Nucky Thompson.

223
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,469
I'm looking
for Harry Daugherty.

224
00:15:25,503 --> 00:15:27,404
Right over there.

225
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:31,540
Mr. Thompson.

226
00:15:31,574 --> 00:15:33,141
Harry Daugherty.

227
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:34,943
- Call me Nucky.
- Nucky it is.

228
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,278
- What can I get you?
- I wouldn't say no to a bourbon.

229
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:39,746
Two double
bourbons on the double.

230
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:41,915
Say that 10 times fast.

231
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,883
Senator Edge sends his regrets.

232
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:45,885
Well, he'll certainly
be missed,

233
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,020
but those in the know say
you're the man to see.

234
00:15:48,054 --> 00:15:50,820
I suppose that depends
on what you want.

235
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:53,488
"As Nucky Thompson goes,

236
00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:55,857
so goes the New Jersey delegation."

237
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:57,592
Well, is it true?

238
00:15:57,626 --> 00:16:00,161
We'll have to wait
and see, now won't we?

239
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:02,162
That's why
I wanted to meet you.

240
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:05,765
See, I think Warren Harding
could go all the way.

241
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,535
Put Edge on that ticket
and we've got a winner.

242
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,404
I like a long shot as much
as the next fella, Harry,

243
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,673
but I'm not quite sure
how you're doping that out.

244
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,042
The front runner's are
Wood and Lowden, right?

245
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:18,911
That Senate inquiry is
a black mark on 'em both.

246
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,946
- The campaign finance.
- Then there's Johnson,

247
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,281
who started the damn
investigation to begin with,

248
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,182
which didn't exactly
win him any friends.

249
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:29,020
The field has no first-raters and
Harding's the best of the second-raters.

250
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,922
Not exactly a rousing endorsement,
but it happens to be true.

251
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:34,724
He certainly
looks like a president.

252
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,926
That's half the battle,
my friend.

253
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:39,328
More than half if those
trollops get the vote.

254
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:41,863
- Great meal last night, Harry.
- Do the right thing, boys,

255
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:45,700
- and steak won't be the only thing on the menu.
- You bet, Harry.

256
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,002
I have quite an appetite
myself, you know?

257
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:53,673
You should meet Warren.
You're gonna like him.

258
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:03,081
Mr. Smith... he invited me.

259
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:06,017
- My name should be on the list.
- Miss Britton, go to your room.

260
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:09,353
- I'll make sure he knows...
- Jess, would you please just
tell Warren that I'm here.

261
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:12,555
Senator and Mrs. Harding, I'd
like you to meet Nucky Thompson,

262
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,891
an esteemed member of
the New Jersey delegation.

263
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:16,960
- How do you do?
- An honor and a privilege.

264
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,428
Senator, I read a speech
you gave back in May

265
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:21,129
in Rhode island, I believe.

266
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:23,965
- "Back to normal."
- Boston, at the Home Market Club.

267
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,199
- Right.
- It was quite something.

268
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:28,001
- Very well done.
- That's nothing.

269
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:31,137
I can spend hours bloviating.

270
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:33,772
You see, Americans don't want

271
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:35,808
someone looking
to stir things up.

272
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:38,043
They want stability,
someone dedicated

273
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:40,112
to safeguarding
America first...

274
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:44,181
...To prosper America
first, to think of America first.

275
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:46,717
My best judgment for
what America needs now

276
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:49,285
is to steady down, to get
squarely on our feet...

277
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,055
Warren, there's a few other
gentlemen I'd like you to meet.

278
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:55,091
Nucky, I hope you'll
consider what we discussed.

279
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,725
A pleasure.

280
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:02,498
You must be awfully
proud of your husband.

281
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:05,133
It's a terrible wretched thing.

282
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:09,404
A fortune-teller told me
he'll die in office.

283
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:18,378
Thank you, Miss Britton.

284
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,466
- Evening.
- Good evening.

285
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,903
- Beautiful child.
- Oh, thank you.

286
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:48,372
A young Republican,
I'm guessing.

287
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,273
She certainly is.

288
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:53,275
- And what brings you to the Convention?
- Oh...

289
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,711
We're, um, friends
of Mr. Harding's.

290
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,881
Well, it's good to have
friends in politics.

291
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,385
Do you have children yourself?

292
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:09,588
No.

293
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:11,989
I had a son.

294
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:13,891
He died.

295
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:16,827
I'm sorry.

296
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:34,541
Bless this food, o lord,

297
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,878
and ourselves
to thy loving service;

298
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:40,881
That we may always
continue in thy faith

299
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:43,983
and fear to the honor
and glory of thy name,

300
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:47,519
through Jesus Christ our lord.

301
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,589
- Amen.
- Amen.

302
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:57,297
The garden...

303
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:00,100
The tulips are looking
a little ragged.

304
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:07,072
What's wrong?

305
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:15,111
You put yourself
through this every month.

306
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:20,783
It means I'm not fully a woman.

307
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,618
- Yes, you are, very much so.
- No.

308
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:26,355
No. No baby
will grow inside me.

309
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,458
And in the place of that joy,

310
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:33,661
every 28 days the blood flows

311
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:35,695
and then I can't help it,
so do the tears.

312
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,430
Please eat.

313
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:59,049
I, uh, ran into Naomi
Ellsworth at the milliner.

314
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,817
Mmm.

315
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:03,587
She said I might be able
to get some help.

316
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:06,989
Must everyone know
our private affairs?

317
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:09,292
She had difficulty
conceiving herself.

318
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:11,727
There was a... a blockage
in her tubes as well.

319
00:21:11,762 --> 00:21:14,829
Why must we always
go on about this?

320
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:16,497
If the lord wanted us...

321
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:18,432
If the lord wanted us
to die of appendicitis

322
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:21,602
then he wouldn't have given
us the ability to treat it.

323
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:29,109
That's Naomi Ellsworth talking.

324
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:32,078
I want to get this fixed.

325
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:37,349
There's a physician in Manhattan.

326
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:40,452
- He can perform a surgery.
- Surgery?!

327
00:21:40,486 --> 00:21:42,587
It's $270.

328
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:45,990
My salary barely meets
expenses as it is.

329
00:21:48,493 --> 00:21:51,127
I want to give you
a son, Nelson.

330
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:10,845
All I want is for you
to be happy, Rose.

331
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:16,182
I'll do what I can.

332
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:23,020
Now please, dear, eat.

333
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:35,330
- She knows what she wants!
- Cover your eyes.

334
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:37,464
You're too good.

335
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:39,332
- Get in there!
- Here we go.

336
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,702
- Look at that.
- I'll tell you,

337
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:45,171
if they had nuns like that, I might
have made it past sixth grade.

338
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:47,608
I don't think anything could have
got you past the sixth grade, Jim.

339
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:49,309
What's this now?

340
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,279
- Oh boy.
- It's called a snatch, Al.

341
00:22:51,313 --> 00:22:53,713
What's that smell like
on a hot summer day?

342
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:57,484
Jesus, where do they
get these women?

343
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,020
If I find out, I'm sure as
hell keeping it to myself.

344
00:23:00,054 --> 00:23:03,156
- Ah. Sorry, boys.
- God damn it.

345
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:05,659
- Come on!
- It was just getting good.

346
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,660
- There we go.
- Back in business.

347
00:23:08,694 --> 00:23:11,697
- All right!
- So are we all straight on the collections?

348
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:13,866
Yeah, I'll take the inlet
to Maryland Avenue,

349
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,700
Fleming will take
the other side.

350
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:18,870
♪ I'll be in Scotland
before ye! ♪

351
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:20,972
How about the casino?

352
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:23,240
- I'll take that myself.
- Are you sure?

353
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:24,541
Yeah.

354
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:26,176
June and I have an affair...

355
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,578
her cousin's wedding.
I'll swing by on the way home.

356
00:23:28,612 --> 00:23:31,246
Sister Mary Catherine!

357
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:34,016
- Uh-oh, bad girl!
- Oh yeah.

358
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,885
Fellas, I think I'm
joining the priesthood.

359
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:43,924
Come on, what's
going on back there, Boyd?

360
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,059
Oh!

361
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,694
- Jesus Christ!
- What the...

362
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:54,432
- Boyd, nice work.
- To too hot to watch.

363
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,601
Good job, Boyd!

364
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,736
- Oh shit.
- Good thinking.

365
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:39,736
Ho, what you doing?

366
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,905
These are friends of mine.

367
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,408
Convenient you waited
till he was done.

368
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:47,576
Standard operating procedure.
It's a new world.

369
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,446
If he could talk, I'm sure
Charlie Sheridan would agree.

370
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,047
You read about that, huh?

371
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:54,649
Your boy Jimmy? My boy.

372
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:57,185
Two rums, Tommy! Oh...

373
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:59,487
wait, that's right...
we ain't got any.

374
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:02,422
You just can't make
your point, huh?

375
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:04,591
Well, where the fuck
is it already?

376
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,194
McCoy's sailing up
from Bimini as we speak.

377
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:09,328
On a raft?
I need delivery.

378
00:25:09,362 --> 00:25:12,464
These broads are over the moon with
this Mary Pickford cocktail.

379
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:14,266
They mix the rum
with grenadine.

380
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:17,268
'Cause the bootleg stuff
tastes like shit.

381
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,638
So you're making a show
at the Convention, eh?

382
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:24,574
It's so nice
to meet your acquaintance.

383
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,877
I'm a politician.

384
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:29,446
There are some things
you can't buy in a cathouse.

385
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:32,114
Salut.

386
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:39,320
So let me ask you, any scuttlebutt
on this Harry Daugherty?

387
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:42,623
- Never heard of him.
- He's Warren Harding's campaign manager.

388
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:44,859
- Never heard of him neither.
- He's a Senator from Ohio.

389
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:47,360
- He's running for president.
- Why didn't you say so?

390
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:50,297
Ohio? You should
talk to Judge Graves.

391
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:53,299
- Who's he?
- See? You don't know everybody.

392
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,967
Your Honor!

393
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:01,205
I want to introduce you
to a dear friend of mine...

394
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:03,307
Nucky Thompson
from Atlantic City.

395
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:05,543
- How do you do?
- Oh, I've never been to Jersey.

396
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:08,212
Staten Island once,
but that was years ago.

397
00:26:08,246 --> 00:26:10,880
Well, you're welcome any time.
At my expense, of course.

398
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:13,750
- Much obliged.
- Here.

399
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:21,056
So I hear you have some
insight into Warren Harding.

400
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,792
Harding? He's a puppet for the
fast-money boys in Cleveland.

401
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:27,294
I used to sit
on the bench there.

402
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:30,631
- You like his chances?
- I like them better with
Harry Daugherty behind him.

403
00:26:30,665 --> 00:26:33,500
- A little cagey, that one.
- But he knows how to treat a friend,

404
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,635
I can tell you that
from experience.

405
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:38,705
These Ohio fellas know what
they're doing, Mr. Thompson.

406
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:40,806
Five presidents
since the civil war.

407
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,507
Judge Graves?

408
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:45,043
Belle's arrived.

409
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:49,980
Gentlemen.
I never keep a lady waiting.

410
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:52,917
- A pleasure.
- Enjoy.

411
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:56,986
Loves his dark meat, this one.

412
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,856
Gotta bring her in special
from the black belt.

413
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,190
Go, get out of here, go!

414
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:05,393
- You think it's funny? Tough guy, move it.
- I gotta take my money.

415
00:27:05,428 --> 00:27:07,596
- Move it! Piece of shit.
- Let go of me.

416
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:12,065
The lady says stop,
that's what it means.

417
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,168
If I see you here again, I'll
cut your fucking pecker off.

418
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:17,203
- Get him outta here.
- Move it.

419
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,280
Nucky.

420
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,382
James.

421
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:37,054
- Is everything all right?
- Why wouldn't it be?

422
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:39,523
What are you doing here?

423
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,391
I've been coming to Chicago
since before you were born.

424
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,527
Who do you think lit that fire?

425
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:47,428
You're looking well.

426
00:27:47,463 --> 00:27:49,564
New suit.

427
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,369
Mr. Torrio's been
very helpful.

428
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:59,440
Call us a cab, Eddie.

429
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:03,476
Excuse me.

430
00:28:04,678 --> 00:28:07,547
If you want, I could
give you fellas a lift.

431
00:28:09,184 --> 00:28:11,651
Old times, eh?

432
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:14,353
Sure, why not?

433
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:18,056
Somehow, James, we've all been
managing to get along without you.

434
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,225
Your family as well.

435
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:25,329
- How are they?
- Why don't you call and find out?

436
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:28,432
I write her every week, Nuck.
She never writes me back.

437
00:28:28,466 --> 00:28:31,368
Next time you buy
a new wristwatch for yourself?

438
00:28:31,402 --> 00:28:34,604
Don't.
Send them the money instead.

439
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:05,430
Lolly?

440
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:09,300
Hello!

441
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,478
What the hell are you doing?

442
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,180
The fuck's going on here?

443
00:29:25,215 --> 00:29:26,981
Don't fucking move!

444
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:33,720
Get the bag!

445
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:37,590
You follow us,

446
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:40,360
we'll kill youse all!

447
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:21,761
I'll tell you, as much as they
crow about their meat here,

448
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:24,931
for my money it's
the occidental in D.C.

449
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:29,301
Your money? When's the last
time you paid for a dinner?

450
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:31,803
Mmm, right after
McKinley was elected.

451
00:30:39,143 --> 00:30:41,278
How bad?

452
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,584
- Excuse me, Walter.
- Everything okay?

453
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:52,286
I need a telephone.

454
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,907
- Hello?
- It's me.

455
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:19,410
What time is it?

456
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,811
I don't know, late.

457
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:23,580
Are you all right?

458
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:26,516
No. Margaret,
there's been an incident.

459
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,017
My brother's been shot.

460
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:31,854
Oh my God, is he dead?

461
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:33,856
No, I don't think so.

462
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,225
- I need you to do something for me.
- I'll go to him immediately.

463
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:39,494
Uh, but I'll need
to call a sitter.

464
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:41,295
No. Actually,
it's my office.

465
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,263
Yes?

466
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:46,132
Eli's being cared for.
He's home with his family.

467
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:48,101
There's a doctor.

468
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:49,836
I need you to go to the Ritz.

469
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,639
- Very well.
- My office... it's been left unattended.

470
00:31:53,673 --> 00:31:56,775
I'll need you to safeguard
a few things,

471
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,909
some business records.

472
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:02,313
What about Mr. Fleming

473
00:32:02,347 --> 00:32:03,981
or one of your aldermen?

474
00:32:04,015 --> 00:32:05,748
I don't know what's
happening right now

475
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:09,485
and until I return I prefer
to rely only on you.

476
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,421
Can I do that?

477
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:13,088
Yes.

478
00:32:13,122 --> 00:32:15,390
Yes, of course.

479
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:19,127
In the top drawer of my desk
is a ledger book.

480
00:32:19,162 --> 00:32:22,696
I want you to take it out, leave it
closed and bring it to my closet.

481
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:26,133
In the back, behind the shoe
rack, is a compartment.

482
00:32:26,168 --> 00:32:30,703
Slip it in there and stay in the suite
with your children until I return.

483
00:32:32,072 --> 00:32:33,840
When will that be?

484
00:32:33,874 --> 00:32:36,475
I'm on the first
train home tomorrow.

485
00:32:38,511 --> 00:32:41,046
Are you all right?

486
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:47,184
I don't know.

487
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,543
What are you drinking?

488
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,546
Whiskey.

489
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,248
I figured only champagne
now with that get-up.

490
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,320
It's bespoke.

491
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:31,022
Al bought it for me.

492
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:34,658
Who's your friend?

493
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:36,959
War buddy.

494
00:33:38,428 --> 00:33:41,697
Richard Harrow.

495
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:45,033
To the lost.

496
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,841
So I'm assuming
this is not a social call.

497
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,778
I need you to come home, James.

498
00:33:57,813 --> 00:34:00,580
Need or want?

499
00:34:00,615 --> 00:34:04,050
Eli's been shot.
They robbed Lolly's.

500
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:06,186
- Who did?
- I don't know.

501
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
We're at war, kid.

502
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,823
They hit Chalky's
a few months back,

503
00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:12,391
killed one of his men,

504
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,993
robbed O'Neill right out
in the open on the boards.

505
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:17,528
- And now this?
- Someone's got it in their head

506
00:34:17,563 --> 00:34:21,299
that I'm weak, that I have no
real means of retaliation.

507
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:24,134
You got the whole Sheriff's
department on your payroll.

508
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,469
And the Sheriff in bed
with a bullet in his gut.

509
00:34:26,504 --> 00:34:30,439
There are things I may require that I'm
uncomfortable asking of Eli anyway,

510
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:32,875
particularly with
the election coming.

511
00:34:40,883 --> 00:34:42,750
This afternoon when you saw me,

512
00:34:42,785 --> 00:34:45,986
you looked at me like I was 
something you scraped off your boot.

513
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:48,555
Now it's 4:00 in the morning,
the world's closing in,

514
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,792
- I'm your long lost son?
- Don't overestimate yourself, James.

515
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:54,994
Why shouldn't I, Nuck?
I'm doing very well here.

516
00:34:55,028 --> 00:34:56,996
And how far will that go?

517
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,931
You're Irish, Torrio's Italian.

518
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:01,099
You'll always be an outsider.

519
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:07,971
You know this suit
cost 70 bucks?

520
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:13,076
You're about as subtle as a kick
in the teeth, you know that?

521
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:23,451
5% of anything
that comes in by boat

522
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:26,821
and 10% of anything
that comes in on wheels.

523
00:35:26,855 --> 00:35:29,123
And that fed?

524
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:31,892
What do I do about him?

525
00:35:31,926 --> 00:35:34,661
I'll work that out.

526
00:35:36,897 --> 00:35:39,364
I got to think about it.

527
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,037
You do that,

528
00:35:46,071 --> 00:35:47,905
but whatever you decide,

529
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,441
don't ever keep me
waiting again.

530
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:28,524
Hello?

531
00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:34,529
Hello.

532
00:37:34,563 --> 00:37:37,632
This is Mrs. Schroeder.

533
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:40,300
Who is this?

534
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:01,953
Well.
This is rather clandestine.

535
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:04,655
Something tells me you're no
stranger to backroom meetings.

536
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:07,057
Quite a back room.

537
00:38:07,091 --> 00:38:09,593
I need to head home.
Something came up.

538
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:11,860
Before the Convention
even starts?

539
00:38:11,895 --> 00:38:13,529
I've made inquiries, Harry.

540
00:38:13,563 --> 00:38:15,597
Heard good things about
you from Judge Graves.

541
00:38:15,631 --> 00:38:17,531
You mean you heard I play ball.

542
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:19,700
Well, don't you?

543
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:22,303
The babe's got nothing
on Harry Daugherty.

544
00:38:22,337 --> 00:38:24,271
I've thought about
what you said.

545
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:26,206
It's slim, but Harding
has a chance.

546
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,174
I thought you were backing Wood.

547
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:30,109
I think he'll
deadlock with Lowden.

548
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,178
- And if that happens, they're both done.
- Delegates won't cross over.

549
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:36,748
Don't expect Harding to be nominated early,
but come the fifth or sixth ballot?

550
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:40,317
Those bleary-eyed delegates will want to
nominate somebody who could actually win.

551
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,286
If that happens,
I'm prepared to throw

552
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,154
the Jersey delegation
behind Harding.

553
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,855
In exchange for Edge getting V.P.

554
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,291
In exchange for Edge
not getting V.P.

555
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:52,628
What am I missing here?

556
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:54,997
That Walter Edge is a dirty
backstabbing chiseler

557
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,998
who gave my road money
to Frank Hague.

558
00:38:57,032 --> 00:38:58,466
How do you know that?

559
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,302
Because Hague's an even
bigger backstabbing chiseler,

560
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:03,603
not to mention a friend.

561
00:39:06,006 --> 00:39:07,674
That's rich, boy.
I'll tell ya.

562
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:10,010
You can tell me something
else while you're at it.

563
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:12,578
Like how you propose to take
care of Harding's lady trouble.

564
00:39:12,613 --> 00:39:15,281
Which lady?
Which trouble?

565
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:17,949
- There are more than one?
- Showgirls, shopgirls,

566
00:39:17,984 --> 00:39:20,385
I've lost count,
to tell you the truth.

567
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,687
One of them's even
blackmailing him.

568
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:24,790
The skirt with the little girl?

569
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:27,124
Naw, she's okay.
She's in love is all.

570
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:29,960
- Name's Nan Britton.
- And the baby's his?

571
00:39:31,296 --> 00:39:33,129
It could cost him the election.

572
00:39:34,465 --> 00:39:36,866
Then let me help.
I'll bring her to A.C.,

573
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,103
put her up till November. I've got 
a lady-friend with kids of her own,

574
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:43,572
they'll look in on her. After the 
election, she's your problem again.

575
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:46,374
And then I get my road money.

576
00:39:47,643 --> 00:39:50,144
I'll have to sell it to Warren.

577
00:39:50,178 --> 00:39:52,746
I'm sure you're quite
the salesman.

578
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,085
You know Al Jolson agreed
to write his campaign song.

579
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,187
Eddie Cantor's better.

580
00:40:08,395 --> 00:40:10,830
Love to hear from you.

581
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:13,097
I'm just surprised, that's all.

582
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:15,466
What, a fella can't call
his mother once in a while?

583
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,469
You can call me
twice a day if you like.

584
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:23,206
I saw Nucky.
He was out here for the Convention.

585
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,009
I'm assuming you've heard
what happened to his brother.

586
00:40:26,043 --> 00:40:28,343
Yeah, that was something, huh?

587
00:40:28,378 --> 00:40:32,214
I swear, this world is going
to hell in a handbasket.

588
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:35,449
Yeah.

589
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:39,554
You sound lonesome, baby.

590
00:40:41,823 --> 00:40:44,091
I was thinking of you.

591
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,926
Are you eating?

592
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:49,361
Yeah, of course.

593
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:52,898
Why don't you come home,
honeypot?

594
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,734
I don't know.

595
00:41:00,572 --> 00:41:04,608
So what can you tell me
about this Luciano fella?

596
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:06,777
Well...

597
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:09,846
Where do I begin?

598
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:14,617
Yeah, those two.
This way, Miss Britton.

599
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:22,591
Nucky!

600
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:26,896
I got your message.
Where are you going?

601
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:29,964
- Home.
- But the delegates haven't voted yet.

602
00:41:29,998 --> 00:41:32,066
Who's gonna get
all our ducks in a row?

603
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,700
- Why don't you ask Frank Hague?
- Hague?

604
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:36,868
What's this all about?

605
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:40,072
We've known each other a long time,
Wally, so why don't you cut the crap?

606
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,773
"Wally"?

607
00:41:42,808 --> 00:41:45,076
You're speaking to a
United States Senator.

608
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,644
And that's all you'll ever be.

609
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:49,013
You made a deal with Hague
to fuck me over.

610
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:52,482
- Nucky, I have no idea what you're talking about...
- Don't insult me.

611
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,187
It was just politics.

612
00:41:58,221 --> 00:42:00,322
I'll make it up to you later.

613
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:02,491
Later when?

614
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:04,459
When I'm in the White House.

615
00:42:04,494 --> 00:42:07,962
Senator, the only chance you
have of entering the White House

616
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:10,998
is on a guided fucking tour.

617
00:44:04,194 --> 00:44:07,761
"I love your back,
I love your breasts,

618
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:10,763
daring to feel
where my face rests.

619
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:14,266
I love your skin
so soft and white,

620
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:18,971
so dear to feel
and sweet to bite.

621
00:44:20,273 --> 00:44:22,373
I love your knees,
their dimples kiss.

622
00:44:22,408 --> 00:44:24,842
I lo your ways of giving bliss.

623
00:44:24,877 --> 00:44:28,012
I love your poise
of perfect thighs,

624
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,748
the way they hold me
in paradise."

625
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,052
That was the first love
poem Warren ever wrote me.

626
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:39,421
He's got quite
a way with words.

627
00:44:42,926 --> 00:44:45,193
We'll be making a coal stop
in 30 minutes, folks.

628
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:47,362
I'm going to freshen up.

629
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:52,799
- Anything out of Chicago?
- Just came over the wires.

630
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:56,002
Warren Harding received the
nomination after 10 ballots.

631
00:45:00,473 --> 00:45:02,474
That imbecile

632
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:05,477
is going to be the next
President of the United States.

633
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,581
"My dearest Rose,

634
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:54,150
like Sarah, Rebecca
and Hannah before you,

635
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:57,921
I urge you to trust
in God's plan,

636
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,756
not just for your own sake,

637
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,623
but also the sake
of any offspring

638
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,726
he may see fit
to bestow upon us,

639
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,862
not only so that you may
know him better,

640
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:12,299
but walk more closely
in his footsteps.

641
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:16,335
Your devoted husband, Nelson."

642
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:55,436
Nucky.

643
00:46:55,471 --> 00:46:57,472
Oh my God.

644
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,408
Everything's going to be fine.

645
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:03,610
It might take awhile,

646
00:47:03,645 --> 00:47:06,046
but we'll get him
back on his feet.

647
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,514
Give us a minute, will you?

648
00:47:22,728 --> 00:47:24,861
How are you doing,
little brother?

649
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:28,899
They came out of nowhere.

650
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:33,135
Nothing I could do.

651
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:41,109
It's only money, forget it.

652
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:44,345
It's more than money.

653
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,881
We're under siege.

654
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,954
I asked Jimmy to come back.

655
00:47:57,056 --> 00:47:58,991
Jimmy?

656
00:47:59,025 --> 00:48:01,959
We need help, Eli.

657
00:48:06,031 --> 00:48:09,733
How many years
have we been doing this?

658
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:13,236
Not once has this
ever happened.

659
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:18,874
It's a new world.

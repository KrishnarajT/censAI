1
00:00:01,191 --> 00:00:03,203
There was a hijacking
in the woods last January.

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,402
Nobody was supposed
to get hurt.

3
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:06,903
Then why did they?

4
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:08,302
I can give you the ringleader.
You can just ask him.

5
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:10,402
- What's his name?
- Jimmy Darmondy.

6
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:14,286
Somehow, James, we've all been
managing to get along without you.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,385
Your family as well.

8
00:00:16,418 --> 00:00:19,251
Nucky Thompson didn't get
where he is by being naive.

9
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,651
- He could stop giving me money.
- What about Jimmy?

10
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:24,317
I would have thought
he'd send something.

11
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:26,284
I told you no doctors, damn it.

12
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,783
Maybe you got worms.

13
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:29,817
Nucky Thompson come by?

14
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,051
No sir, he sent Mr. Boyd
on by with your envelope.

15
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:35,884
Getting too big
for his britches.

16
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,716
What is this obsession
with this Schroeder character?

17
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:43,150
You requisitioned the
immigration file on his wife?

18
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:45,950
I've been waiting for
a report on Mr. Darmondy.

19
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:48,483
- I'm with his wife right now.
- No you're not, Charlie.

20
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:50,117
You're with his mother.

21
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:51,850
I need you to come home, James.

22
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,850
There are things I may require that
I'm uncomfortable asking of Eli,

23
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:56,817
particularly with
the election coming.

24
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:59,184
He invited me.
The name should be on the list.

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,751
Tell me something
else while you're at it.

26
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:03,285
Like how you propose to take
care of Harding's lady trouble.

27
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:04,651
Name's Nan Britton.

28
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:06,818
I'll bring her to A.C.
Put her up till November.

29
00:01:06,853 --> 00:01:10,019
I'm prepared to throw the Jersey
delegation behind Harding.

30
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,453
You could wait in the hall.

31
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:14,721
I don't like that fella.
I never have.

32
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:16,487
He's a good man, Halloran.

33
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:17,854
What the hell are you doing?

34
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:24,556
There's been a incident.
I prefer to rely only on you.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,074
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

36
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:43,856

37
00:03:04,654 --> 00:03:06,528
It's crazy.

38
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:10,426
While it's happening you don't
think you'll ever forget it.

39
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:13,729
Then once it's over,
you can barely recall a thing.

40
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:16,732
But it's them, right? You're sure 
these are the guys who held you up?

41
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:20,102
- Absolutely.
- These three definitely.

42
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:22,304
This is the little prick
who spit in my face.

43
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:25,942
The D'Alessio brothers...
a family of dagos out of Philly.

44
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:28,878
Second-story men
who graduated to stick ups.

45
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:32,282
They robbed Bookbinder's
in '17, the restaurant.

46
00:03:32,316 --> 00:03:35,219
Killed two customers,
shot a waiter in the face.

47
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:38,289
- Jesus Christ.
- Little bastard called me fat.

48
00:03:38,323 --> 00:03:40,323
They're fucking killers, George.

49
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:42,425
Sounds to me
like you got off easy.

50
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,794
Why, sure. I was just...

51
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:46,963
I need to talk to my brother.

52
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,766
Feel better, eh?

53
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,147
These fucking guineas...
They're desperados, Nuck.

54
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,982
We gotta track 'em down
and squash 'em

55
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,885
before they spill more blood.

56
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,420
It's not just blood
I'm worried about;

57
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:14,624
it's ink.
You see the paper today?

58
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:16,659
June doesn't like to upset me.

59
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:19,862
Fletcher, this reformer
running for Mayor...

60
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:22,165
He gave an interview
alleging corruption

61
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,934
in both the Mayor's
and the Sheriff's office.

62
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:26,269
He mentioned me by name?

63
00:04:26,303 --> 00:04:28,338
"Has Mayor Bacharach even questioned

64
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:30,139
what Sheriff Eli Thompson was doing

65
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:32,541
at an illegal casino at 3:00 A.M.?"

66
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,310
So I was there. So what?

67
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:36,311
How's he know I wasn't
answering a call?

68
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,280
Because he knows, Eli.
Everybody does.

69
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:40,183
It just never made
the paper before.

70
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:41,584
Fuck 'em.

71
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,786
Let them write what they want.

72
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:47,256
The election, Eli...

73
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,325
We gotta keep the tide
flowing in our direction.

74
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,928
I'll get out then,
press the flesh,

75
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:53,396
drum up some support.

76
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,465
What about your spleen?
Dr. Surran says you should rest.

77
00:04:56,504 --> 00:05:00,002
How do you rest your spleen?

78
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:02,405
- Come on, Grant.
- That water was cold.

79
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,108
Let's tell the ladies.
Oh, that was amazing!

80
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:08,277
Way out there.

81
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:26,328
Do you believe in love at
first sight, Mrs. Schroeder?

82
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:30,031
It's a rather romantic notion.

83
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:33,670
It happened to me
the day I saw Warren.

84
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:35,805
Senator Harding?

85
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,643
I was 16,

86
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:41,778
and he was the handsomest man

87
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:44,247
I'd ever met.

88
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:46,749
Of course he wasn't
Senator yet.

89
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:49,552
He ran the newspaper
back in Marion.

90
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:53,822
Houdini's brother...
His name is Hardeen.

91
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:55,824
And when I first heard Harding,

92
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:58,961
I thought it was him
running for president.

93
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,631
He loves me

94
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:04,966
and he loves his baby daughter.

95
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:08,737
But America needs him

96
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:12,207
and so I have to sacrifice.

97
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:30,224
Marguerite.

98
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:33,327
- Good morning.
- Madame Jeunet.

99
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:36,030
This is a friend of
mine, Miss Nan Britton.

100
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:38,499
She needs a few outfits
for the season.

101
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:42,202
C'est gentil.
We exist to oblige.

102
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:44,038
Maryska.

103
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,941
Maryska!

104
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:52,780
See the mademoiselle
to the dressing room.

105
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:55,082
This way.

106
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,887
A cow waiting to be milked...

107
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,889
the Polish girl.

108
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,523
No grace, no charm.

109
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,058
Well, I imagine
she's still learning.

110
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,294
A head like a cabbage.

111
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,330
But she will work
for pennies.

112
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:15,333
You see what I am reduced to?

113
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:19,337
Is business slow, ma'am?

114
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:25,510
My dear Marguerite,

115
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:27,445
how you have blossomed.

116
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:31,048
Mr. Thompson is quite
generous with his attentions.

117
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:33,016
He does treat me well.

118
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:36,620
The finest things
for the finest ladies,

119
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:39,256
as it must be here.

120
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,792
But the cost is very high,

121
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:43,994
and then on top I must pay.

122
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:47,564
- Pay whom?
- Mr. Thompson of course.

123
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,633
Oh, you mean the city.

124
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:54,337
I am told now
I must pay double.

125
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,905
Everyone must.

126
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,074
I have saved nothing,
Marguerite.

127
00:07:58,109 --> 00:08:01,077
All to run the shop.

128
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:03,280
I am a woman alone.

129
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:05,382
You understand this.

130
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,517
Can you not speak
with your alderman?

131
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:10,620
You can speak for me...

132
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:12,856
to the man who gives you
his attention.

133
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,526
I... I wouldn't know
what to say.

134
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,663
Say that he is handsome;
How happy he makes you;

135
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:24,400
And how can you buy the things
that make you pretty for him

136
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:27,203
if there is no belle femme?

137
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:30,372
Help me, Marguerite.

138
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,677
You have power
you do not suspect.

139
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,548
Oh bonjour, madame.

140
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:42,151
Leave no stone unturned.

141
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:43,986
You and your men
wire every department

142
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:45,688
from Philly to Pittsburgh.

143
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:48,191
- You should also write to...
- Nucky.

144
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:51,161
Jesus. A little notice
would've been nice.

145
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,929
- I sent a telegram.
- We have received nothing.

146
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:56,865
I will call the 
Western Union to complain.

147
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:00,134
I'd offer you coffee,
but it looks like

148
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:02,604
you've already helped yourself.

149
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:05,874
The train... the dining
car was out of service.

150
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:09,210
- You haven't been home?
- I thought I should see you first.

151
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:13,948
- Have them send up a steak.
- Ja.

152
00:09:19,355 --> 00:09:21,189
So you're here.

153
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:24,760
- I assume you've accepted my offer?
- With conditions.

154
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:30,064
My friend Richard Harrow...
You met him in Chicago.

155
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:32,532
- The man in the iron mask?
- He's a war hero.

156
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:35,470
- I'd like him to join me.
- What's under there?

157
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:39,105
He's missing
his cheekbone, his jaw.

158
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:41,509
Basically the whole left side
of his face is gone.

159
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,942
And he's still alive?

160
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,449
Medicine, huh?

161
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:50,249
A lot of fellas still alive
probably shouldn't be.

162
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:52,885
Well, I know a few myself.

163
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:57,657
- The D'Alessio brothers out of Philly.
- Another condition:

164
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,260
We keep what we discuss
only between us.

165
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:05,298
Wait outside.

166
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:21,847
So these are the guys
that robbed the casino?

167
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:23,882
And O'Neill as well.

168
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:28,821
Ignacious, Sixtus, Leo...

169
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:31,389
- They're all named after Popes.
- Write the Vatican,

170
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,858
see if they know
where they are.

171
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:43,835
When I find them...

172
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:48,706
What do you want me to do?

173
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:50,809
You need me to spell it out?

174
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:53,043
I'd like to hear you say it.

175
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,379
Why?

176
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,477
Politician to the last, huh?

177
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:04,757
What, you don't say it, you
don't have to deny it later?

178
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,995
Or are you just trying
to kid yourself?

179
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:10,509
About what?

180
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:12,865
The fact that
you're a murderer, Nuck.

181
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,336
That is what you
want me to do, right?

182
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,238
Kill them?

183
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:24,142
Yes.

184
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:39,190
Even the kid?

185
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:59,744
I'm gonna go eat my steak.

186
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:31,310
- Gentlemen.
- A.R.

187
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:33,379
These are the fellas
I told you about.

188
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:36,215
This is Leo D'Alessio,

189
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,018
- his brother Ignacious.
- And Mickey Doyle.

190
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,287
An honor, Mr. Rothstein.

191
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:42,654
So you've heard of me.

192
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:45,157
- Naturally. Who ain't, huh? 
- Yeah.

193
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:49,527
And what is it you've heard?

194
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:52,469
- Good stuff, you know.
- That I'm honest?

195
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:55,066
That you'll always
get a square deal?

196
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:57,803
Sure, that's why we're here.

197
00:12:57,838 --> 00:13:01,540
A reputation takes
a lifetime to build

198
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:04,109
and only seconds to destroy.

199
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,957
I understand you're interested in
the liquor business.

200
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:19,925
We's interested in makin' dough.

201
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,959
Piles of it.

202
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:25,463
Eight ball, $500.

203
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:28,199
You break.

204
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,874
There are two ways
to make money

205
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:36,943
in the alcohol business.

206
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:40,180
One is to take cheap rotgut
whiskey, dilute it and sell it.

207
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:43,182
- I was doing good with that myself.
- That's the stupid way,

208
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:45,652
in which I have no interest.

209
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:53,326
There's a growing demand for good
whiskey in the United States.

210
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,062
And I'm not talking
about the swill

211
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:57,497
you stirred up
in your chamberpot.

212
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,834
I'm talking about the
best scotch from Britain.

213
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:05,137
There's a fortune to be
made from importing it.

214
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,577
It'll be the chic thing to have
good whiskey when you have guests

215
00:14:10,611 --> 00:14:14,381
and the rich will vie
with one another to serve it.

216
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,253
I want to set up a business
for importing scotch.

217
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,755
We'll have ships
with crews we can trust

218
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:25,057
who'll sail it from
the distilleries in Europe

219
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:27,326
and unload it outside
the three-mile limit.

220
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,194
All we have to do
is smuggle it ashore.

221
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:30,762
That's where you mugs come in.

222
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:33,632
The ports of Atlantic City
are ideal for distribution

223
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,434
to the entire eastern seaboard.

224
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:38,003
The only problem is the man
who runs that city.

225
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:42,674
Normally I'd make a deal
with such a man,

226
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,678
cut him in as a partner,
but I find Nucky Thompson

227
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:50,080
to be greedy and unreasonable.

228
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:55,220
Nothing a bullet in the eye won't fix.

229
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:59,757
If you'll each sign
those forms,

230
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:03,094
I'll take it as your acquiescence
to our new arrangement.

231
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,698
- What are they?
- Life insurance policies.

232
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:09,901
There's a half a million
on each of you.

233
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:11,703
You'll be handling

234
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:13,905
large amounts of my money,
gentlemen.

235
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:16,441
It's my assurance
you won't chisel me.

236
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,178
Think of it as an incentive

237
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,546
not to screw
things up.

238
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,514
I'll show you out.

239
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,607
Do you know
what the nice thing is

240
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:52,576
about the Bronx zoo, Charlie?

241
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,213
There's bars between you
and the monkeys.

242
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:08,124
Finally asleep.

243
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:10,192
I could've read them
some more of this.

244
00:16:10,227 --> 00:16:12,828
You seem to be
enjoying it yourself.

245
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:14,530
"The wonderful love magnet...

246
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:15,998
As long as I carry it,

247
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:18,333
every living thing I meet
will love me dearly."

248
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:21,302
That would make your election
easier, wouldn't it?

249
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:24,638
- Certainly cheaper.
- Is winning expensive?

250
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,689
Not as expensive as losing.

251
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,243
And will Mr. Harding
be president?

252
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:30,711
That depends.

253
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:33,848
Are you planning to vote for him?

254
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:37,552
I've perhaps seen him in not
the most flattering light.

255
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:41,488
- You mean the girl.
- Her name is Nan.

256
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,461
If we only elected good men,
we'd never have leaders.

257
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:48,661
If not good, then what
should they be?

258
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:52,265
Useful... to those
who support them.

259
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:58,371
I was speaking with
madame Jeunet today.

260
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:01,708
- Oh? 
- She says she's going to lose the shop.

261
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,011
It's a pricey location.

262
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:08,247
Apparently she's having
trouble with the city.

263
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:11,417
Then she should talk
to her alderman.

264
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:15,332
She did. It didn't help.

265
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:22,505
Maybe there's something the 
County Treasurer could do.

266
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:27,232
- Did she ask you to bring this up?
- No.

267
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:30,302
Then why are
we discussing it?

268
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:33,443
She showed me a kindness
and I thought to return it.

269
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:37,108
I made her hire you, Margaret.
Kindness didn't come into it.

270
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:38,809
Then you should recompense her

271
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:40,911
for the burden
you made her carry.

272
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:44,815
What did she tell you exactly?

273
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,752
Only that the money
she pays has increased

274
00:17:47,786 --> 00:17:49,754
and it's more
than she can afford.

275
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:52,222
Then she shouldn't be doing
business in Atlantic City,

276
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:55,518
- Because that's what it costs.
- But if you set the price...

277
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:58,094
Margaret, this is not
a suitable topic.

278
00:17:58,129 --> 00:17:59,930
I wasn't aware of that.

279
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:05,569
You're aware now.

280
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:17,914
Will you not be staying?

281
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:22,585
I have an early meeting.

282
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:32,595
I painted this last October.

283
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,132
- She was an actress in the vaudeville. 
- Huh.

284
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,401
It's pretty.

285
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,004
This...

286
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,406
There's a lyrical quality.

287
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,511
It's reminiscent of Mary Cassatt.

288
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,381
Do you think your friend
is visiting soon?

289
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:53,183
The art dealer?

290
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,685
Oh, he's abroad
at the moment... Paris.

291
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,554
The city of light.

292
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,259
Oh, God damn it.

293
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:05,662
- I broke the cork.
- Here.

294
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:12,702
There.

295
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:15,171
Oh my, you uncivilized artists.

296
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:18,141

297
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:20,410
1918...

298
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:23,647
That's the year we met you.

299
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:31,254
Alright, save some
for your jealous husband.

300
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,328
Mm.

301
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,542
Come.

302
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,388
It's okay, darling.

303
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:07,357
I don't bite.

304
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:12,427
- I, uh...
- Everyone in Paris is doing it.

305
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:21,496
Hello?

306
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,906
Ange?

307
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:27,243
Angela, it's me.

308
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:29,078
Hello?

309
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:30,980
It's Jimmy.

310
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:33,082
It's me.

311
00:20:38,955 --> 00:20:40,823
Why is the door locked?

312
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,725
We've had intruders
in the neighborhood.

313
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,963
- Where's the baby?
- He's sleeping.

314
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:55,305
Jimmy, my God.

315
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,074
You're having a party?

316
00:20:58,108 --> 00:21:00,009
We're just visiting.

317
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,882
May I pour you some wine?

318
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,384
I heard that's
against the law now.

319
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,526
Well, it is getting late
and, uh, you have

320
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,127
that sitting in the morning.

321
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:19,595
Oh yes.

322
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,632
A wedding portrait.

323
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,801
Lithuanian couple.

324
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:34,611
Well, it was nice
to see you, old boy.

325
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:36,913
Welcome home again.

326
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,436
- You should have told me you were coming.
- I did.

327
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:04,740
Goddamn Western Union!

328
00:22:10,614 --> 00:22:14,683
- What... what are you doing?
- I'm kissing you.

329
00:22:14,718 --> 00:22:16,585
Wait... You show up
out of nowhere,

330
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,154
not a phone call for months...

331
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:20,389
Ange, look, I'm home okay?
For good.

332
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:24,627
- You're hurting me!
- I missed you.

333
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,066
Yes, I will.

334
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,767
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

335
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:16,342
They only had the plain ones...

336
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:18,611
That was Western Union.

337
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:20,813
They just got a call
from Nucky Thompson's butler

338
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:25,150
inquiring about a wire
from James Darmody.

339
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,952
They said it was
passed on to you.

340
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:32,956
- Oh my God.
- What is the meaning of this?

341
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:35,325
I have it here.

342
00:23:38,963 --> 00:23:41,765
- I was going to give it to you.
- Then why didn't you?

343
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:50,674
"Arriving Thursday,
11:00 A.M. train."

344
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:56,246
- That was yesterday.
- I'm sorry, it slipped my mind.

345
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,382
You're either
incompetent or a liar.

346
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,584
I won't stand for it
either way, Agent Sebso.

347
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,889
- We've been so... 
- I will not stand for it either way!

348
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:08,158
Why was this hidden?

349
00:24:09,894 --> 00:24:12,863
Because I'd like
to keep my job.

350
00:24:12,897 --> 00:24:14,665
Supervisor Elliot...

351
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:18,368
He thinks we're being obsessive
about the Hans Schroeder case,

352
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:21,138
about Nucky Thompson.

353
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:23,040
We have a witness
that can place

354
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:25,409
Darmody at the scene
of the murders.

355
00:24:26,911 --> 00:24:28,645
I wasn't thinking.

356
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,791
You kill a snake by cutting
off the head, Agent Sebso.

357
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:42,726
The supervisor?

358
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,195
Nucky Thompson!

359
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:47,474
Darmody gives him up,
this entire city,

360
00:24:47,512 --> 00:24:52,102
this Sodom, will be
cleansed all at once.

361
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:54,104
There's coal in the ground,

362
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:58,475
lumber in the forests,
cattle in the fields.

363
00:24:58,476 --> 00:25:00,110
What sound does the cow make?

364
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:01,745
- Moo!
- That's right.

365
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,047
You ride that train,
you look out the window,

366
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:07,047
you don't see anything but
opportunity from coast to coast.

367
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,210
And now he's returned to this one.

368
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,654
And now I'm home, Ange,
where I belong.

369
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,524
When you feel like showing up.

370
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:18,427
I had business out west.

371
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:22,163
I told you, but that's...
that's all taken care of.

372
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:24,132
So now what?

373
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:27,235
Now our prospects
are looking up.

374
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:30,104
- Nucky made me an offer.
- Assistant clerk?

375
00:25:30,138 --> 00:25:33,480
Let's just say that we're out
of this dump in no time flat.

376
00:25:33,518 --> 00:25:37,111
Marven Gardens, those
beach houses on Ventnor...

377
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:39,349
How does that sound?

378
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:46,153
Hello?

379
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:49,023
Okay okay.

380
00:25:49,057 --> 00:25:50,757
Sweetie, come here.

381
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:54,160
Yeah, just keep him there.

382
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:56,596
Bye.

383
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,132
- Mush!
- No, no mush today.

384
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,767
Eggs.

385
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:04,304
- Who was that?
- It was my mother.

386
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:07,073
I got to go see her.
Come on, champ.

387
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:31,562
What are you doing?

388
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:33,630
I'm making more coffee.

389
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:57,354
Let's have another baby.

390
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,993
What do you say?
You want a little brother, champ?

391
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:04,863
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

392
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:08,434
Then it's settled.

393
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:16,508
Your stomach is growling.

394
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,343
Are you hungry?

395
00:27:18,377 --> 00:27:21,046
I wouldn't mind
eating you for lunch.

396
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:25,986
Maybe for dessert.

397
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:43,269
Got any coffee left?

398
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:45,513
I can manage that.

399
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:26,112
- Oh! Fuck!
- I wasn't sure if you took cream.

400
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:29,215
It's not there, dear.

401
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,851
- You fucking twat.
- Hey!

402
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:33,153
That's my mother
you're talking to.

403
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:35,521
My apologies.

404
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,028
So you're Luciano.

405
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:44,063
My mother told me
a lot about you.

406
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,998
We're very close, Charles.

407
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:47,800
Plus we have a mutual friend

408
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,134
in Chicago.

409
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:51,837
Al Capone says hello.

410
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:54,840
That's a lot of baloney.
Capone's no pal of mine.

411
00:28:54,874 --> 00:28:56,608
You're right.
Actually he didn't say hello.

412
00:28:56,642 --> 00:28:58,977
He said I should blow
your fucking brains out.

413
00:28:59,011 --> 00:29:01,447
I'd consider it a great
favor if you didn't.

414
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,782
Get dressed.
We're gonna take a ride.

415
00:29:03,816 --> 00:29:07,086
- To where?
- Someplace they won't find you.

416
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:19,931
Come on, move it.

417
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,939
It don't gotta be
like this, you know?

418
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,008
Tell Nucky I'll talk to A.R.,

419
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:31,477
call off the D'Alessios.

420
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:33,246
- What?
- We'll cut him in.

421
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,281
There's plenty
to go around for every...

422
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,451
Drop the gun!

423
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,020
Now.

424
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,262
James Darmody,
you're under arrest.

425
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:55,534
What are you smiling at?

426
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:57,870
You fellas.

427
00:29:57,904 --> 00:30:01,207
- Youse are a sight for sore eyes.
- Hands on the wall.

428
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:03,309
Fuck.

429
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:07,747
Mid-July and they're
all over the place already.

430
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:09,881
How am I supposed
to compete with this guy?

431
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,416
That's the spirit, Mr. Mayor.

432
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:14,618
I want these placards
taken down.

433
00:30:14,652 --> 00:30:17,054
Any shop that posts one
gets a $25 fine.

434
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,823
- Can we do that?
- We can do whatever we want.

435
00:30:19,857 --> 00:30:23,293
- When's Eli coming back?
- Stitches opened up.

436
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:25,762
Doc Surran said this'll probably
set him back another month.

437
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:27,330
It gets better
and better, doesn't it?

438
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:29,232
He's left a big void,
I'll tell you that.

439
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,474
He's not dead, Halloran.

440
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:34,672
I know, but the men,
the other deputies,

441
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,509
they're gonna need
some guidance...

442
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:38,510
Schedules, assignments,
that kind of thing.

443
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:40,211
Can't Eli handle that?

444
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:41,880
Not in the state he's in.

445
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:44,015
What are you trying to say?

446
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:48,119
That I think
I should be in charge.

447
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:50,888
- Oh, you do?
- I've got the most experience

448
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:52,724
and the other fellas
look up to me.

449
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:55,093
Fine, you're acting Sheriff.

450
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:57,362
Really?

451
00:30:57,396 --> 00:30:59,530
- Should I reconsider?
- No no.

452
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:02,300
No.

453
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:03,801
Thanks, Nucky.

454
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:05,703
I know we've had
our differences,

455
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,640
but I want you to know
that I'm here for you,

456
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:11,609
now and in November.

457
00:31:11,677 --> 00:31:13,611
What does that mean?

458
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:16,381
Have you thought
about the future?

459
00:31:16,415 --> 00:31:18,483
It certainly sounds
like you have.

460
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:20,919
In regards to Eli, I mean.

461
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:24,188
The election's right around the
corner and he's hurt, weak,

462
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:27,058
the reformers
are alleging corruption.

463
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:30,795
I mean you've seen the
articles yourself, right?

464
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:34,365
All I'm saying is that
I'm at your service

465
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,934
should you need.

466
00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:41,405
- I was at the picture show.
- Which one?

467
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:43,874
- "Wagon Tracks."
- What was the plot?

468
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:46,410
Are you sure you want
me to ruin the ending?

469
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:48,579
We can do this all day,
Mr. Darmody.

470
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:50,681
It feels like
we already have been.

471
00:31:52,384 --> 00:31:54,284
You're proposing

472
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,854
that on the night
of January 17, 1920,

473
00:31:57,888 --> 00:31:59,855
you were in
a moving picture show

474
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,158
from 7:00 P.M.
until 11:30 P.M.?

475
00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:04,594
That's right.

476
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,332
The running time of the film
is only 78 minutes.

477
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:11,634
I fell asleep.

478
00:32:26,516 --> 00:32:29,751
You have a child
out of wedlock.

479
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:32,121
Is his mother not fit to marry?

480
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:34,356
That's none of your business.

481
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:37,360
What's the name of the 
William S. Hart character in the movie?

482
00:32:37,394 --> 00:32:40,196
- Buckskin? Buck-something.
- You're not sure?

483
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,164
We're engaged.
We're going to be married.

484
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:45,734
Your aim at making her
a respectable woman.

485
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:49,972
How do you know Hans Schroeder?

486
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:52,174
I don't know Hans Schroeder.

487
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:55,110
- Mrs. Schroeder? Margaret?
- I don't know these people.

488
00:32:55,144 --> 00:32:57,846
Lucy Danziger, she's a
dancer at Ziegfeld Follies.

489
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,881
- You know her?
- It's Nucky's girlfriend.

490
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:01,516
Then what is the relationship

491
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,719
between Mr. Thompson
and Mrs. Schroeder?

492
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:10,692
You want to know who Nucky
Thompson is fucking,

493
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:12,828
why don't you ask him?

494
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:24,072
This shipment of alcohol
that Mr. Thompson sold

495
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:26,241
to Arnold Rothstein,

496
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:28,309
the shipment that was
being transported

497
00:33:28,344 --> 00:33:30,644
the night of January 17th...

498
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:33,246
- "Wagon Tracks."
- How do you know Al?

499
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:34,915
- I don't know any Al.
- From Chicago?

500
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:36,916
You've got it all mixed up, officer.

501
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:46,629
Did Mr. Thompson have
Hans Schroeder murdered

502
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:49,031
because he's in love
with Schroeder's wife?

503
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:57,538
The men in the woods...
How many did you kill?

504
00:33:59,449 --> 00:34:01,408
I went to the movies.
I fell asleep.

505
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:03,510
I got up. I walked home.
I went to bed.

506
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,846
You wanna charge me, charge me.

507
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,948
I've got nothing else to say.

508
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:11,285
I thought you might find
some satisfaction

509
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,655
in living long enough to see
your son grow into a man.

510
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,892
- You don't got anything on me.
- Don't I?

511
00:34:32,674 --> 00:34:33,941
Billy?

512
00:34:33,975 --> 00:34:36,310
- Jimmy?
- Jesus Christ.

513
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:37,912
They were gonna send me
up the river, Jimmy.

514
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:40,815
- What did you say to them, Billy?
- Fucking Rahway.

515
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:42,454
- What'd you tell them?
- Jimmy!

516
00:34:42,484 --> 00:34:44,752
- Billy, what'd you say to...
- Jimmy!

517
00:34:44,787 --> 00:34:46,888
Fuck!

518
00:34:48,757 --> 00:34:50,891
The old days, it was different.

519
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:53,694
You could count on people
to vote the party line.

520
00:34:53,729 --> 00:34:55,430
Now these democrats come along,

521
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:57,331
make big promises.

522
00:34:57,366 --> 00:34:59,233
And you're concerned.

523
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:02,303
Enough not to take
anything for granted.

524
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:06,573
I wish there was a way
I could help.

525
00:35:06,608 --> 00:35:08,208
There is.

526
00:35:08,243 --> 00:35:11,979
You can help us get
the women's vote.

527
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:16,383
Shouldn't you wait until the
amendment actually passes?

528
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,652
I'm an eternal optimist.

529
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,756
Speak to your friends,

530
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:25,526
the Temperance League,
other women's organizations.

531
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,464
I'm not much of an orator.

532
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:30,263
I've seen you speak.

533
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:32,699
You comport yourself very well.

534
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,167
When was that?

535
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:37,403
At my birthday
with Senator Edge.

536
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:39,806
Oh, that was merely banter.

537
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,576
He's a United States Senator and
you wiped the floor with him.

538
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:50,816
Seriously, would you
be willing to speak

539
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,985
on behalf of the party?

540
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:59,025
- I suppose so, but...
- But what?

541
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:04,597
Do you not wish me
to dress well?

542
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:06,365
What do you mean?

543
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,635
Do you not wish me
to look attractive?

544
00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:11,804
Of course I do.

545
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,907
I mean you are,
whatever you're wearing.

546
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:19,678
- Nucky, you have a call.
- All right.

547
00:36:20,947 --> 00:36:24,583
Madame Jeunet knows
what suits me.

548
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:27,453
She knows how to
make me look pretty.

549
00:36:27,488 --> 00:36:30,923
She's the only one I trust.

550
00:36:30,957 --> 00:36:33,759
That's why you want her
to stay in business?

551
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:37,996
Why didn't you just say
that in the first place?

552
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:41,566
I didn't want you to know
how selfish I was.

553
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,237
I never hold that
against anyone.

554
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:54,412
Hello?

555
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:55,847
Today?

556
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:06,483
- Thank you.
- 10 minutes.

557
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,201
Did you talk to Angela?

558
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,103
She's aware of the situation.

559
00:37:19,138 --> 00:37:23,174
D'Alessios... They're being
backed by Rothstein and Luciano.

560
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,476
From the horse's mouth.

561
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:29,480
Luciano spilled it to me
before I was arrested.

562
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:33,117
Can you bail me out?

563
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:35,052
Five counts of murder...
There is no bail.

564
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,555
- Would you get me a lawyer at least?
- For what?

565
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:41,391
You know, to talk to,
plan a strategy.

566
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,060
It's a waste of money.

567
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,695
Then, uh...

568
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,968
Call my dad.

569
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,503
Can't he help?

570
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:56,007
Your dad?
Are you that nervous?

571
00:37:58,077 --> 00:37:59,877
This kid, Billy Winslow...

572
00:37:59,912 --> 00:38:01,679
He's gonna testify, Nuck.

573
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:04,249
- So I've heard.
- So I'm staying here?

574
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,950
Is that what you're saying?

575
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:07,819
You said you were going
to take care of this.

576
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:10,555
I am. All I'm saying
is the legal system's

577
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:12,957
not your ticket to freedom.

578
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:17,896
Uh, yes, I'm still
on the line, operator.

579
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,530
Thank you.

580
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:21,899
Sir.

581
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:24,802
Nelson, I was in a command meeting.
What's the hubbub?

582
00:38:24,837 --> 00:38:26,804
We've arrested
James Darmody, sir.

583
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:29,407
What? When?

584
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,743
Last night.
He returned from Chicago.

585
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:35,747
- Did he talk? 
- No, but he's aware we have his accomplice.

586
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:38,683
- Either way, the road leads to Thompson.
- Wonderful, Nelson.

587
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:41,085
Terrific. It's a real shot
in the arm for the Bureau.

588
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,254
Thank you for
your confidence, sir.

589
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,522
Keep up the good work.

590
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:55,766
- What did he say?
- He was pleased... very much so.

591
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,569
Congratulations, sir.

592
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,571
I didn't do it alone.

593
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,977
I'm sorry about the telegram.

594
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:08,347
That was very foolish of me.

595
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:11,417
It was, but people
make mistakes.

596
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:20,057
A man needs to have the
courage of his convictions.

597
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,161
I knew we'd get
Darmody eventually.

598
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:27,162
You were right.

599
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,331
Hmm.

600
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,773
This witness, Billy Winslow...

601
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,909
You think it's safe
to keep him here?

602
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,479
What'd you have in mind?

603
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,382
Move him north pending trial?

604
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:49,385
Federal jail
in Manhattan maybe?

605
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,056
Keep him out
of Thompson's reach.

606
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:07,536
Jesus Christ, will you
see a doctor already?

607
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,305
Stubborn as a mule.

608
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:11,340
Shut up and get him a drink.

609
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,644
I'm fine, thank you.

610
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,614
You look like shit.

611
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,949
Well, your time comes,

612
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:23,151
you just have to
accept your situation.

613
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:25,286
Are we talking about you or me?

614
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,756
This Fletcher
and these fucking democrats.

615
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,660
And your Sheriff
is out of commission now too?

616
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:35,130
It's not so easy, is it?

617
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:37,465
Nice that you can
still find joy.

618
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,568
Five years in jail...
Can you blame me?

619
00:40:40,603 --> 00:40:42,370
One of us had to go.
You knew that.

620
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:44,972
- I had no choice.
- Neither did I.

621
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:46,466
Which is why we made a deal,

622
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:48,445
so let's put it to bed
where it belongs.

623
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:53,280
We're in trouble.

624
00:40:53,315 --> 00:40:56,384
Mayor Bacharach...
He's weak and losing ground.

625
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:01,689
Even the fucking dog is sick.

626
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:10,731
Well, what do you
have on Fletcher?

627
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:12,400
Nothing.
He's clean.

628
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:14,334
What does he want?

629
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:15,835
He wants to be Mayor.

630
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:19,839
Fucking boy scout.

631
00:41:22,242 --> 00:41:26,679
Well, replace him.

632
00:41:26,713 --> 00:41:28,581
What do you mean?

633
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:31,450
Bacharach.
Run somebody else for Mayor.

634
00:41:31,485 --> 00:41:34,320
People want change,
give it to them.

635
00:41:34,354 --> 00:41:37,123
Or at least pretend
to give it to them.

636
00:41:37,157 --> 00:41:39,191
What do I do about Eli?

637
00:41:39,226 --> 00:41:43,295
Replace him too.

638
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:49,568
You son of a bitch.

639
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:51,904
I'm dying.

640
00:41:51,938 --> 00:41:54,072
There's no time
to be sentimental.

641
00:41:56,576 --> 00:41:59,077
I still can't decide.

642
00:41:59,112 --> 00:42:03,815
On you every dress
is a joy to behold.

643
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:05,950
They're all so plain.

644
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:10,921
I'll need something special
to wear to the inaugural.

645
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:18,729
I think for now though just 
something to wear around town.

646
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,669
Oh, I do so love this.

647
00:42:24,703 --> 00:42:27,304
Mademoiselle's taste
is excellent.

648
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:32,275
- How much is it?
- $480.

649
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:35,011
I'll try the yellow one on again.

650
00:42:50,762 --> 00:42:52,429
You have rescued me.

651
00:42:52,464 --> 00:42:55,398
Merci beaucoup.

652
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,401
- I'm glad I could help.
- The first day you came here,

653
00:42:59,435 --> 00:43:01,503
to myself I say,

654
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,105
"This is a lady
of taste and judgment."

655
00:43:08,976 --> 00:43:11,611
You told me I smelled.

656
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:13,013
Pardon?

657
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:16,317
- You said I needed to bathe more often.
- No.

658
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,053
I was as useless
as the Polish girl.

659
00:43:19,087 --> 00:43:21,355
- Until now.
- No no.

660
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,659
My English...
still sometimes I misspeak.

661
00:43:24,694 --> 00:43:27,496
I am grateful, Marguerite,

662
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,965
very grateful.

663
00:43:38,374 --> 00:43:40,153
For your little one.

664
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:55,156
Ivory...

665
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,494
For her beautiful hair.

666
00:43:59,127 --> 00:44:02,696
My daughter didn't help you,
madame Jeunet.

667
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,399
I did.

668
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:13,448
I just had to try it on.

669
00:44:15,742 --> 00:44:18,878
It is beautiful, isn't it?

670
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:35,229
Ah!
Smell that air, the salt?

671
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:39,033
I'd like to live
by the ocean someday.

672
00:44:41,237 --> 00:44:43,605
I have a cousin, a rich kid...

673
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,446
Ok, the rich kid took the grand
tour, sailed all over world,

674
00:44:46,447 --> 00:44:47,809
but he puked the entire way.

675
00:44:49,746 --> 00:44:52,882
Seasickness.

676
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,785
I gotta piss.

677
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,355
You need to go?

678
00:44:59,389 --> 00:45:01,591
I'll stretch my legs.

679
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:49,593
Shouldn't have done that.

680
00:45:52,964 --> 00:45:55,407
- Done what?
- Tried to plunge for my weapon.

681
00:45:56,174 --> 00:45:57,708
What are you talking about?

682
00:45:57,743 --> 00:45:59,477
You plunged at me,

683
00:45:59,511 --> 00:46:00,778
tried to commandeer my gun

684
00:46:02,981 --> 00:46:04,816
That's why I killed you.

685
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:42,182
I spoke to
my friend, the art dealer.

686
00:47:42,216 --> 00:47:45,085
He's not interested,
unfortunately.

687
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,020
But you seemed so optimistic.

688
00:47:49,054 --> 00:47:51,354
Well, he's staying in Europe.

689
00:47:51,388 --> 00:47:53,490
Did he say why?

690
00:47:53,524 --> 00:47:55,692
His response was in a wire.

691
00:47:55,726 --> 00:47:57,463
Surely with your husband home

692
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,196
your financial burden
has eased.

693
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,765
- You'll have other chances.
- When?

694
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,234
I'll make some inquiries,
but honestly...

695
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:09,506
Your style is a rather cheap
imitation of Mary Cassatt's.

696
00:48:15,846 --> 00:48:19,315
I was in the
woods with my boyfriend Ernie.

697
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,183
He said to me,
"It's dark out here.

698
00:48:21,218 --> 00:48:24,654
I wish had a lantern."
I said, "Me too.

699
00:48:24,688 --> 00:48:28,791
You've been munching on the
grass for the past 10 minutes!"

700
00:48:29,926 --> 00:48:31,460
"Speaking of that," he said,

701
00:48:31,494 --> 00:48:34,730
"how come you never tell me
when you reach a climax?"

702
00:48:34,764 --> 00:48:37,098
"Well, Ernie," I said,

703
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:40,302
"it's because you're never
around when it happens."

704
00:48:41,938 --> 00:48:44,506
There's nothing wrong
with being an opportunist.

705
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:48,210
In fact, it's a trait I admire.
The steel pier, the boulevard project...

706
00:48:48,244 --> 00:48:50,579
You were Johnny-on-the-spot with those.

707
00:48:50,614 --> 00:48:53,382
A good Christian, family man,

708
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:56,651
- well-liked in the community.
- Very impressive.

709
00:48:58,954 --> 00:49:02,322
- What are you looking for?
- The other shoe.

710
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,391
Right now I'd like to sing
a little number for you

711
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:07,826
called "Some of these Days."

712
00:49:16,907 --> 00:49:19,466
Perhaps Mrs. Bader
would like a better view.

713
00:49:23,946 --> 00:49:27,082
Have I told you how beautiful
you look in that dress?

714
00:49:27,117 --> 00:49:29,492
It was a gift
from Madame Jeunet.

715
00:49:32,988 --> 00:49:37,859

00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:41,162

723
00:49:59,318 --> 00:50:02,321
So I'm assuming
you didn't ask me here

724
00:50:02,355 --> 00:50:04,123
to sing my praises.

725
00:50:04,157 --> 00:50:06,358
Of course not, Edward.
I can't sing a note.

726
00:50:07,793 --> 00:50:10,428
How'd you like to be Mayor?

727
00:50:10,472 --> 00:50:12,630
With you as boss?

728
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:15,265
I'd have more authority
as street-sweeper.

729
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,474
But a lot more time to run
your construction business.

730
00:50:18,514 --> 00:50:19,970
It's time for a change, Ed,

731
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:21,572
and you're a solid republican.

732
00:50:21,606 --> 00:50:24,041
- What about Bacharach?
- Mayor Bacharach is ill.

733
00:50:24,075 --> 00:50:27,377
- He will not be seeking re-election.
- What's wrong with him?

734
00:50:27,412 --> 00:50:30,114
I'll make my diagnosis as
soon as I have your answer.

735
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,786
- I have to discuss it with Kathryn.
- Be decisive, Ed.

736
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,822
Roads, hospitals,
convention center...

737
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:41,473
We can build
great things together.

738
00:50:41,502 --> 00:50:44,961
Of course we'll have to add a
ball field onto that list.

739
00:50:46,229 --> 00:50:48,397
1920.

740
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:50,832
The world belongs to the young.

741
00:50:50,867 --> 00:50:53,702
We'll let them think it does.

742
00:50:53,736 --> 00:50:56,138
Mayor Edward Bader.

743
00:50:56,172 --> 00:50:58,307
You roll that around
on your tongue.

744
00:50:58,341 --> 00:51:00,777

- or face the wrath of Mombo...
- Hah!

752
00:51:22,265 --> 00:51:25,067
...Tribal chieftain of the Zulu...

753
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:27,536
from the dark continent of Africa!

754
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:30,908
Raised among lions
and every bias fierce,

755
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:34,311
the Zulu have a thirst
for human blood!

756
00:51:34,345 --> 00:51:36,480
Pity the poor souls
unfortunate enough

757
00:51:36,481 --> 00:51:38,948
to spend the last
of their days...

758
00:51:38,982 --> 00:51:41,016
We'll need to stop by
the ambassador.

759
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:43,350
I told Jim Neary we meet
him for a nightcap.

760
00:51:43,385 --> 00:51:45,552
It's rather late, isn't it?

761
00:51:45,586 --> 00:51:48,890
- Hiya, Nuck.
- Evening.

762
00:51:48,924 --> 00:51:51,393
Nucky?

763
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:53,895
Nucky Thompson!

764
00:51:59,969 --> 00:52:01,703
Nein.

765
00:52:09,645 --> 00:52:12,247
You filthy bastard!

Is that a cop?
Get a cop!

769
00:52:18,287 --> 00:52:20,254
He went that way!

770
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:22,189
Call an ambulance!

771
00:52:22,224 --> 00:52:23,624

773
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,069

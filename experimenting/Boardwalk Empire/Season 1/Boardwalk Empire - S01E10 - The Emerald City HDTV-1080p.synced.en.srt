2
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:18,604
I'm sorry. Don't mind. Don't be afraid.

3
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,108
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,776
I won't hurt you.

5
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:27,780
Mama!

6
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:35,413
We're on edge here as it is.

7
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:37,748
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,751
It's not comfortable to sleep with.

9
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:45,631
Mama!

10
00:02:53,223 --> 00:02:54,557
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:01,063
He said he had to make water

12
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:06,152
and if I didn't pull over, he'd do it right there,
in his trousers, on the car seat.

13
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:09,071
- You should have let him.
- Nelson.

14
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,907
I had to go myself, sir.

15
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,494
It's almost four hours' drive to Manhattan.
I'd had several cups of coffee.

16
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:20,333
I stopped the car, relieved myself,

17
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,793
then unlocked Winslow's handcuffs.

18
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:24,962
In other words, you dispensed with protocol.

19
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:28,966
To not do so would have meant
unbuttoning his trousers and...

20
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,594
And touching his johnson with your fingers.

21
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:32,970
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:37,224
So in service to your own modesty,
you ended up killing our witness.

23
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,852
You will not be told again, Nelson.

24
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:45,316
Nothing in his demeanor led me to believe
that he'd attack me, sir.

25
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,193
The man was a felon.

26
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:54,283
You got anything else to say?

27
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,618
I know I fouled up,

28
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,871
but killing that prisoner...

29
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,335
It'll haunt me for the rest of my days.

30
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,384
You acted in self-defense.
You've been exonerated.

31
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:18,933
- Take a week's leave, get some rest.
- Yes, sir.

32
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,143
Thank you, sir.

33
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:24,188
That is all.

34
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:35,241
Have you any idea, Nelson,

35
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:38,452
the embarrassment

36
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,413
this incident has brought
upon the department?

37
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:43,958
I take full responsibility
for Winslow's death, sir.

38
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:47,586
That's fine, Nelson, because that's precisely
where I place the blame.

39
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:51,757
I told you I wanted numbers,
arrests relating to alcohol.

40
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,760
Winslow's confession
is a direct link to Nucky Thompson.

41
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:57,263
Winslow is dead.
His confession is useless hearsay.

42
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:58,764
I'll have another crack at Darmody.

43
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,183
Darmody has been released
for lack of evidence.

44
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,519
Thompson's lawyers
are swarming like hornets.

45
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,896
He committed murder
on a direct order from Nucky Thompson.

46
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:09,191
For God's sakes, man,
you have bungled this from the start!

47
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:23,289
This is your last chance, Nelson.

48
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,541
One more misstep

49
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,628
and you'll be hunting moonshiners
down in the Everglades.

50
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,416
Don't stop.

51
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,879
There's coffee.

52
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:20,137
Your mother took Tommy
to Child's for an ice cream.

53
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,434
He's a good boy.

54
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,571
It's nice, the skin tones.

55
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:40,491
Thank you.

56
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,953
I also like the other one...

57
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,038
The lady with the flowers.

58
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,458
I didn't even think you noticed.

59
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,884
Over in Europe,

60
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:03,848
the war... Art, painting, poetry...

61
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:09,103
Two weeks in the trench and you forget

62
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:13,899
that there's anything beautiful
in the civilized world.

63
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,185
That's it.

64
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,440
A little red.

65
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,278
That's better.

66
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:09,098
Anything on the ratification?

67
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:12,268
It's all in the hands of Tennessee.

68
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:16,230
One more state,
then women will have the right to vote.

69
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,108
You look doubtful.

70
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,069
I don't want you to be disappointed.

71
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:27,408
The South, they're not exactly known
for their forward thinking down there.

72
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,958
- Your driver Mr. Kessler is here.
- Five minutes.

73
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,217
- I don't mean to be cruel, but...
- He's a war hero, Margaret.

74
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:47,052
He frightens the children.

75
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:50,389
He's here for your protection,
for their protection.

76
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,393
These men who are after you,

77
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:57,438
- has anything been done?
- It's being handled.

78
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,065
- By the sheriff?
- And his deputies.

79
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:05,654
Perhaps the children and I
should go away for a while.

80
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:06,989
That won't be necessary.

81
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,494
Besides, I'd miss you too much.

82
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:18,792
Is this what it means to be in charge?
People shooting at you?

83
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,088
Success breeds enemies,

84
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:26,091
which you'll discover soon enough,
after women win the vote.

85
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,725
Stock prices over the ticker,

86
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,352
racing results by wire.

87
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,104
Soon radio, I'm told,
will transmit news stories

88
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:41,023
within minutes of their occurrence.

89
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,484
It's the age of information,

90
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:47,696
and a businessman lives,
and sometimes dies, on its value.

91
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:53,494
Do you know why I'm a successful gambler,
Mr. Doyle?

92
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:56,372
'Cause you're lucky?

93
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,542
He's Lucky. I create my luck.

94
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:06,548
I'm a successful gambler
because I never bet on an event

95
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,009
whose outcome I'm not sure of in advance.

96
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:10,511
Like the World Series.

97
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,723
You put the fix in.

98
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,436
I employ research, fact finding...

99
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:23,273
- "Due diligence" the lawyers call it.
- Which brings me to Nucky Thompson,

100
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:27,403
the man you said you know everything about.

101
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,279
How was I supposed to know
his chauffeur carries a gun?

102
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:32,658
Have you been listening
to a single word I've said?

103
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,496
Sheer and utter incompetence!

104
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,374
A woman is shot,

105
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:45,003
an innocent tourist, no less,
and you've tipped my hand to Thompson.

106
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:49,716
The Boardwalk at night, do it in public...
We figure it sends a message.

107
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:53,220
You sent a message, all right.
That you're idiots.

108
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:58,434
Devil's food?

109
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,935
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

110
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:04,106
- I'll kill that prick myself, Mr. Rothstein.
- We'll bring you his head if you want.

111
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:10,112
Your grandstanding is commendable,
but I have to say I'm less than convinced.

112
00:12:10,238 --> 00:12:12,990
We had bad information, like you said.

113
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,577
How can we make it up to you?

114
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,041
Nothing says "I'm sorry" like money.

115
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:33,635
Two and a half million people
in Chicago alone,

116
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,722
figure half of them are men.

117
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,390
- Half of those...
- Put that in.

118
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,851
...are adult men, and there's my point.

119
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:45,397
With over half a million potential customers
who wanna drink whiskey and fuck,

120
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,274
why ain't we making more money?

121
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:51,737
Fuck you doing? Are you listening?

122
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:55,282
- What?
- You listening?

123
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,576
Yeah, the money.

124
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:01,830
Mr. Torrio, Jake Guzik.

125
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,582
Sure, send him in.

126
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:07,586
There's the beer baron.

127
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,463
Are you giving the cooze away?

128
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:11,798
I had to park all the way up Wabash.

129
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,592
A little exercise will kill you?

130
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:16,470
I get enough exercise carrying your dough.

131
00:13:19,974 --> 00:13:21,558
All this from the brewery?

132
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:24,269
I go home stinking of beer,
but who's complaining?

133
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:27,231
When he ran the brothel, he stunk of pussy.

134
00:13:27,398 --> 00:13:30,442
So long as it ain't kugel,
the wife stays off my back.

135
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,444
I wanted to talk to you about expanding,

136
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:35,030
and not just your waistline neither.

137
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,574
- I was saying...
- Johnny, Turkish.

138
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:42,204
Before you come in, I was saying,
a lot of money being left on the table.

139
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,207
As far as I'm concerned,
the whole North Side is wide open.

140
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,919
There's entire 10-block stretches

141
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:51,463
without a single cathouse
or a place to get a drink.

142
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:58,178
The fuck is this?

143
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,514
It's a load from the joke shop.

144
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,140
What are you, 12 years old?

145
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:04,476
It's a joke. I'm sorry.

146
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:06,770
You are sorry. You're a sorry fucking moron.

147
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:08,230
I thought you'd have a laugh.

148
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,526
I'm in the middle of a fucking meeting!

149
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:24,079
We'll talk Saturday, your kid's...
What do you call it?

150
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,040
- Bar mitzvah.
- Yeah.

151
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,960
This ain't no fucking grade school.

152
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,006
He's grotesque, James.

153
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,883
And believe me,
I've seen my share of freak shows.

154
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,512
Apparently, it's a big improvement
over how he looked before the surgery.

155
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,181
Try explaining that to a 4-year-old.

156
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:47,019
From now on, when he's in the house,
just tell him to keep the mask on.

157
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,938
Mickey Doyle.

158
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,649
- What about him?
- To see you.

159
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,569
- Here?
- Shall I frisk him?

160
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:58,196
You're Tom Mix all of a sudden?

161
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:59,615
You do it.

162
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:22,763
Nucky, hey, how you been?

163
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,265
- What do you want, Mickey?
- Come on, Nuck.

164
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,559
I come to youse hat in hand.

165
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,608
I came to apologize, is all.
I got rattled when you took my operation.

166
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,235
So you pick yourself up by the bootstraps.

167
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:41,657
Yeah, but I told you I have partners.

168
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:42,741
So?

169
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,743
The D'Alessio brothers.

170
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,037
From Philly?

171
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:48,205
Mmm-hmm.

172
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,248
- They're your partners?
- Mmm-hmm.

173
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,214
I should throw you out that fucking window.

174
00:15:57,298 --> 00:15:59,383
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what they was planning.

175
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:01,760
Not half as sorry as you're gonna be.

176
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:06,431
I can help. That's why I come here.
I'll tell youse everything I know.

177
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:13,647
Get him a drink.

178
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,191
I should piss in it.

179
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:43,051
It started months back, after I got out of jail.

180
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:46,513
They wanted their dough, which I didn't have,

181
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:48,724
so they got the idea
to put Chalky out of business.

182
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,517
- The lynching, that was them?
- Mmm-hmm.

183
00:16:50,768 --> 00:16:54,938
They robbed your ward boss, too.
The fat one. Plus the casino.

184
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:57,649
They shot my brother, Mickey,
took a shot at me.

185
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:59,067
I know it.

186
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:04,156
They're gonna shoot me, Nuck.
I know that, too.

187
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:06,950
- How?
- They're always jabbering in Italian,

188
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:09,202
laughing at me behind my back,

189
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:10,746
right to my face.

190
00:17:10,872 --> 00:17:13,331
And Luciano. How does he figure in?

191
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,293
- Your mother didn't tell you?
- Watch your step, Mickey.

192
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:18,795
He's got this kid,
some sheeny named Lansky.

193
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:22,549
He approached Chalky, made him an offer,
but it was really just a whatsit.

194
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,093
- A ruse?
- That's the ticket.

195
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,720
To find out how many bottles he's moving.

196
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:29,139
- Why does he wanna know that?
- Why do you think?

197
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:31,016
For information.

198
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,769
This is all on orders from Rothstein.

199
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:34,978
He wants to muscle in,

200
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:38,023
take over the liquor business in Atlantic City.

201
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:39,816
Ruining baseball isn't enough?

202
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:45,155
- Get Chalky on the phone.
- Yeah.

203
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,532
For what?

204
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:55,165
Eddie's on the line.

205
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:57,209
God damn it. Eddie!

206
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:00,295
Hang up the goddamn phone.

207
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,756
That was Trenton. It just came over the wire.

208
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,884
The women have received
the permission to vote.

209
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,727
"'I built that palace,
and the Emerald City, too,

210
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:17,979
"remarked the Wizard in a thoughtful tone.

211
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:19,815
"'And I'd like to see them again,

212
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,692
"'for I was very happy
among the Munchkins and Winkies

213
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:24,569
"'and Quadlings and Gillikins."

214
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,738
"'Who are they?" asked the boy.

215
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:30,116
"'The four nations that inhabit
the Land of Oz" was the reply.

216
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,585
Sorry.

217
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,424
Mr. Harrow.

218
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Hmm?

219
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:54,057
We're reading The Wizard of Oz,
by Frank Baum.

220
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,475
Yes.

221
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,895
Please join us if you'd like.

222
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,316
Thank you.

223
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,870
"'I wonder if they would treat me nicely
if I went there again? '

224
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:17,497
"'Of course they would" declared Dorothy.

225
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:19,708
"'They are still proud of their former Wizard,

226
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,002
"'and often speak of you kindly.

227
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,963
"'Do you happen to know
whatever became of the Tin Woodsman

228
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,173
"'and the Scarecrow? ' He enquired.

229
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:29,175
"'They live in Oz yet" said the girl,

230
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,636
"'and are very important people."'

231
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,768
The Tin Woodsman.

232
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,147
That's me.

233
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,112
I think I need some oil.

234
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:53,325
Mama, it's really him?

235
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,370
Why, yes, dear, directly from Oz.

236
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:04,502
And who better to have in our house
than the mighty Tin Woodsman?

237
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:15,281
I won't insult you
by asking if you want any,

238
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,867
but I hope you don't mind if I have a taste.

239
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,412
Good news just isn't the same without it.

240
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:22,747
Annabelle offered me some earlier.

241
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:25,458
Does that mean I shouldn't try again?

242
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:29,629
Well, it is a special occasion.

243
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:31,881
That it is.

244
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:35,051
Thank you.

245
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:43,143
To the women's vote.

246
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:45,353
You've caught up with Ireland at last.

247
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,772
It's your country, too, you know.

248
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:57,741
You're aware, of course,
of all the Republican Party has done

249
00:21:57,825 --> 00:21:59,159
for social progress.

250
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,536
Emancipation, Prohibition.

251
00:22:02,163 --> 00:22:03,371
We backed the women's vote early.

252
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,708
Because you saw an opportunity.

253
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:09,044
A simple "thank you" would be fine.

254
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:11,755
Thank you.

255
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,638
Sunday, at the League of
Women Voters luncheon,

256
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:23,767
Mayor Bacharach will be announcing
that he won't be seeking reelection.

257
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:26,144
I'd like you to tell the ladies

258
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:29,064
why Edward Bader should be his replacement.

259
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:31,149
And why should he be?

260
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,194
Because he's the right man for the job.

261
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,321
The owner of a construction business?

262
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:40,658
Who's going to help me build great things
for the people of this city.

263
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,954
But how does that qualify him to be mayor?

264
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,833
Andrew Johnson was a tailor
and he became president.

265
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:51,044
Wasn't he impeached?

266
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,464
That's completely beside the point.

267
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,262
What am I meant to say?

268
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:05,141
That it's time for a change,
that it's a new Republican Party.

269
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:07,811
The cronyism, the incompetence,

270
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:10,021
the violence in our streets.

271
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:12,649
All that's a thing of the past.

272
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:14,109
Is it?

273
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:16,528
What do you mean?

274
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:20,365
If Bader is elected,
what happens to the county treasurer?

275
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,534
Me? I'm not going anywhere.

276
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,286
You'll control the new mayor
just like the old one?

277
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,081
I don't control anyone, Margaret.

278
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,625
I'm more of an overseer.

279
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,795
For this city to work,
for business to be done over the long haul,

280
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,881
there needs to be cooperation,
continuity of leadership.

281
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:40,468
As county treasurer, I provide that continuity.

282
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:44,055
Fletcher and these other Democrats,
they'd be starting from scratch.

283
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:49,185
You're asking me to lie
about Bader's qualifications.

284
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:55,233
I'm asking you to be realistic.

285
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,320
This isn't some fantasy world,
like in one of those children's books.

286
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,030
It's a real place with real people.

287
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,367
And sometimes, to make it run properly,

288
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,703
we need to tell those people
what they want to hear.

289
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:14,043
This is important, Margaret,
not just for the Republican Party.

290
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,629
It's important for you, too.

291
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,861
Look at this. Look, Tommy, look.

292
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,070
This is where we got you.

293
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,615
They cooked you up
in one of those incubators,

294
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:46,451
wrapped you up in a diaper,
and then we took you home.

295
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:49,954
- You're fooling me!
- Fooling you, huh?

296
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,418
Hey, where you going?

297
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,462
Tommy, Tommy, come here.

298
00:24:58,422 --> 00:24:59,756
Come here.

299
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:02,258
You want some taffy?

300
00:25:02,343 --> 00:25:04,594
That's Mommy's kissing friend.

301
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:06,971
What'd you say?

302
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,474
That's Mommy's kissing friend.

303
00:25:12,102 --> 00:25:13,645
"Kissing friend"?

304
00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:23,655
Son of a bitch!

305
00:25:24,448 --> 00:25:25,490
Jimmy, what's wrong?

306
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:27,951
Ask your son!

307
00:25:28,786 --> 00:25:33,498
Wendell, I'm gonna need you to be very still,
like a statue in a museum.

308
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,009
Wendell!

309
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,224
You wanna have your mettle tested?

310
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,894
Oh, my God! Get back!

311
00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:03,152
Jimmy.

312
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:05,405
Don't fucking move.

313
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:07,824
Jimmy!

314
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,118
Jimmy, why are you doing this?

315
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:12,453
Jimmy, stop.

316
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:14,622
- Jimmy!
- Hey, buddy!

317
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:15,707
Hey, pal.

318
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,835
Jimmy, stop it, please!

319
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:20,378
Daddy!

320
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:25,258
This man had relations with my wife...

321
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:27,677
- That's not true.
- ...when I was away in the war.

322
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,681
- No, Jimmy. Please, stop it.
- Daddy, Daddy.

323
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:33,975
Daddy!

324
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:38,855
Coming.

325
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:46,904
Ma'am.

326
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,198
Agent Van Alden.

327
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:51,034
May I come in?

328
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:54,871
Of course, yes. Please.

329
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:07,258
This is Mr. Harrow.

330
00:27:09,553 --> 00:27:10,720
I'm a federal agent.

331
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:14,557
I need to speak privately with Mrs. Schroeder.

332
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:17,852
I'll be out back with the children.

333
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,371
Mrs. Schroeder, I'm going
to show you a photograph.

334
00:27:36,747 --> 00:27:40,124
I'd like to know if you recognize this girl.

335
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:46,964
Is this meant to be a joke?

336
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,550
I find nothing funny about it.

337
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:53,971
That's me,

338
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:55,848
taken at Ellis Island.

339
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:58,684
After your long journey from Kerry.

340
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,813
That's right.

341
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,482
When I look at this girl, I see hope,

342
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:09,654
yearning, a promise for a new life,

343
00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:12,615
the promise of America.

344
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:16,911
What happened to that girl, Mrs. Schroeder?

345
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:20,331
Am I to be deported?

346
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,291
I'm a citizen of this country now.

347
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:26,838
Mrs. Schroeder,
you are consorting with a murderer,

348
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:29,757
the man who killed the father of your children.

349
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,176
- That's not true.
- It is true.

350
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:34,512
He's a panderer and a criminal.

351
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,848
Mr. Thompson is one of the most...

352
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:39,767
Your life doesn't have to be like this.

353
00:28:41,437 --> 00:28:43,396
And I know you don't want it to be.

354
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:50,111
- You don't know me at all.
- I can see into your soul, Margaret,

355
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,697
at night, when I look at this picture.

356
00:28:57,494 --> 00:29:00,621
- Give me that photograph.
- Listen to me.

357
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:03,499
How dare you lecture me?

358
00:29:04,918 --> 00:29:08,880
You gained entrance to my home
on the pretense of official business,

359
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:13,050
when your true intentions are
obviously something quite different.

360
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:16,304
Is this the life you want?

361
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,806
I can offer you salvation.

362
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,726
I want you to leave now.

363
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:29,775
I came here to save you.

364
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,862
Not from prosecution,
but from the fires of hell

365
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:36,991
that will surely await you
should you fail to repent.

366
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,686
You need to say this word for word.

367
00:30:08,482 --> 00:30:10,107
Find us some seats.

368
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,402
Hiya. Who's this handsome man?

369
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:22,370
- Hello.
- Hey.

370
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:26,207
You must wear a hat in the synagogue.
It's a sign of respect.

371
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,711
- To wear it is a sign of respect?
- Yes.

372
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:33,548
Wear a hat in church, they box your ears in.

373
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:39,971
In the Jewish religion, men wear a yarmulke
to remind us that God is above us.

374
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,935
- You're a friend of the bar mitzvah?
- Jake?

375
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:48,354
Mr. Guzik's son.

376
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:51,691
Yeah, I'm an associate of Jake's.

377
00:30:57,698 --> 00:31:00,199
Hey. So this party,

378
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,076
what is it exactly?

379
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,248
When a Jewish boy reaches 13,
he becomes a son of the commandment,

380
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:11,377
and this celebration
affirms his obligations as a man.

381
00:31:11,461 --> 00:31:12,587
What, at 13?

382
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,299
Do you not feel that's old enough
to be held accountable for your actions?

383
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,554
I know the state does.
That's why they got reform school.

384
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:27,685
All of us who are worth anything
spend our manhood

385
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:31,105
unlearning the follies of our youth.

386
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:34,817
Gentlemen, we're about to begin.

387
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:37,528
- We'll finish this later.
- Good, okay.

388
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:44,994
You should wear a yarmulke.

389
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:46,370
What's wrong with this?

390
00:31:46,997 --> 00:31:50,666
You're a man, yet you wear the cap of a boy.

391
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:12,146
Amen.

392
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,217
Amen.

393
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:46,555
Mazel tov!

394
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,650
Meyer Lansky,
that's the kid who came to see you.

395
00:32:57,901 --> 00:33:00,027
He told me his name was Michael Lewis.

396
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,698
So he doesn't have to change
the monogram on his shirts.

397
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:07,118
He's in cahoots with Arnold Rothstein
and this family of dagos out of Philly.

398
00:33:07,244 --> 00:33:08,786
Charlie Luciano, too.

399
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,956
- Those the boys who shot you?
- Among other things.

400
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,792
They shot at him. They were not successful.

401
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,336
Why are you still here?

402
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,256
If there will be nothing else...

403
00:33:25,262 --> 00:33:26,804
Sorry I'm late.

404
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:32,101
What'd you do to your hand?

405
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,730
I slammed it in the icebox.

406
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:41,026
I want you to meet with Lansky.
Mickey here will arrange it.

407
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:42,528
Tell him you accept his offer.

408
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,656
- What offer?
- Whatever offer he makes.

409
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:47,241
Tell him you're unhappy,

410
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,368
that Nucky's not treating you right.

411
00:33:49,453 --> 00:33:50,870
That shouldn't be too hard to believe.

412
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:52,955
You're lucky to be alive, you fucking Polack.

413
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:56,083
Promise them as much liquor as they want.

414
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:58,836
And tell them they'll need
all their men to haul the load.

415
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:02,131
The idea is to get as many of them
in the same place as we can.

416
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:05,676
Remembering, of course,
it was me who set it up.

417
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:12,725
So,

418
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:16,020
when all is said and done,

419
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,858
what you fixing to do about Mr. Rothstein?

420
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:25,613
I'm going to make him
the richest corpse in New York.

421
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:32,119
And go though I must,
I assure you I do so with a heavy heart.

422
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:37,124
But behind my sadness,
there is also great pride

423
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:40,711
in what we have achieved as a community.

424
00:34:42,422 --> 00:34:45,257
And a great optimism...

425
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:48,844
It's perfectly natural to be nervous.
Just remember to breathe.

426
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:51,013
It's not nerves exactly.

427
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,431
Did you eat a good breakfast?

428
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,268
- I've got no appetite.
- You'll be fine.

429
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:59,855
The first time I had to make
one of these speeches, I was a wreck.

430
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,441
After a while, you can get up there
and sell snake oil.

431
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:05,027
And my love for public service
shall never cease.

432
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,826
Ladies,

433
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,744
it is now my great pleasure

434
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:16,413
to introduce Mrs. Margaret Schroeder.

435
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:44,316
Thank you, Mayor Bacharach.

436
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:46,277
And thank you, ladies.

437
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,281
You will surely be missed.

438
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,417
When I was first asked to speak to you today,

439
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:06,714
I confess I was at once flattered and terrified.

440
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:10,092
Surely, an immigrant to this great country,

441
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,220
a former parlor maid,
could have little to contribute

442
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,139
to political discourse.

443
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,894
But when I heard I was to speak
in support of Edward Bader for mayor,

444
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:24,940
I put my trepidations aside
and decided to speak to you from the heart.

445
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:26,233
I know. Thank you.

446
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:29,028
I first met Mr. Bader socially

447
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:33,032
in his capacity as head
of the city's largest construction firm.

448
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:36,660
Mr. Bader is quite literally a builder,

449
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,871
a man of great vision.

450
00:36:39,205 --> 00:36:44,084
Where other men see an empty lot,
he sees a hospital.

451
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:49,298
Where other men see an overgrown field,
he sees a school for our children.

452
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:51,508
And most importantly, perhaps,

453
00:36:51,593 --> 00:36:55,429
where other men see
shop girls and chambermaids,

454
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,348
Edward Bader sees voters.

455
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:11,236
Ladies, our newly gained right
also comes with great responsibility.

456
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:14,865
A duty to use our power wisely,

457
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:17,660
to elect men to office,

458
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:21,914
worthy men, who will put the interest
of our citizens first.

459
00:37:22,624 --> 00:37:25,459
With us as a foundation, women voters,

460
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,171
our new mayor can do
great things for Atlantic City.

461
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:34,385
And who better to start with that foundation
than a builder himself?

462
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:41,725
Ladies, I give you our next mayor,
Mr. Edward Bader.

463
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:52,945
That was wonderful.

464
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,202
Thank you, Mrs. Schroeder,
for that rousing introduction.

465
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:07,835
Ladies, I could not be more pleased
than I am right now to join you here today

466
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:13,674
and welcome you as meaningful partners
in our great democracy.

467
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:22,766
When I was approached
to be part of this Republican ticket,

468
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:28,188
I was not only humbled,
but excited to continue my work

469
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:31,400
for the men, the women,
and the children of Atlantic City.

470
00:38:34,487 --> 00:38:36,363
Enjoy yourself, Loretta.

471
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,323
Have some drinks.

472
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,326
Mr. Torrio.

473
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:50,252
- Where are you going?
- Wherever you tell me.

474
00:38:55,008 --> 00:38:57,009
I'm here to apologize.

475
00:38:57,093 --> 00:39:00,763
The joke, the cigarette load, that was stupid.

476
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:02,931
You can't do that shit no more.

477
00:39:03,516 --> 00:39:04,725
I know.

478
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,563
You know,

479
00:39:10,273 --> 00:39:13,400
I brung you out here from Brooklyn
for a reason, kid.

480
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:16,320
I thought I saw something in you.

481
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,906
A fellow like Guzik.

482
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,784
Three years ago, he's running a cathouse.

483
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,702
Now look at him today.

484
00:39:23,787 --> 00:39:25,954
You could learn something from these Jews.

485
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:30,501
The brewery there,
I hear they're looking for help.

486
00:39:30,877 --> 00:39:32,544
His distribution's out of whack.

487
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:34,922
The fellow there now
has got it all screwed up.

488
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:38,425
Maybe I can fix it.

489
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:41,011
No more monkey business, Al.

490
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,513
Finito.

491
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:45,099
I hear you, Mr. Torrio.

492
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:48,102
All's I'm asking for is a chance.

493
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:51,063
I'm ready to be responsible for my actions.

494
00:39:57,237 --> 00:40:01,949
Twenty-two year I know Nucky Thompson,
back when the Commodore had this town.

495
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,619
I ran the dice game here,
in Chicken Bone Beach.

496
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,205
Nucky made the Commodore collection.

497
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:12,000
Then one day, I seen the Commodore himself.

498
00:40:13,086 --> 00:40:16,004
A parade here for Mr. Booker T. Washington.

499
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:19,466
"Chalky," he say,

500
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:21,718
"I got bad news.

501
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:25,514
"Now on, you got to pay me 7%
of what you been making."

502
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,683
"7%?" I say.

503
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,271
"I been paying Nucky 12 long
for three years now."

504
00:40:32,355 --> 00:40:35,774
- Real prick that guy, Thompson.
- That's putting it kindly, son.

505
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:37,818
- He was skimming off the top.
- Yes.

506
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,736
Thank you. I get it.

507
00:40:41,614 --> 00:40:44,408
Well, I hope his reputation precedes him,

508
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:46,869
but Mr. Rothstein doesn't do business
like that.

509
00:40:46,953 --> 00:40:49,037
Chiseling your partners, it's short-sighted.

510
00:40:49,122 --> 00:40:52,166
- We're looking to the future.
- These stills,

511
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,501
this piss water you're bottling?

512
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:57,462
Don't get me wrong, it's fine for some people,

513
00:40:57,547 --> 00:40:59,715
but we're looking for the real stuff.

514
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:02,217
Can you part with 500 cases a month?

515
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,345
You know I can,

516
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,763
Mr. Lewis.

517
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,185
No offense.

518
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,770
That was before Mr. Doyle here
told us how unhappy you were.

519
00:41:13,897 --> 00:41:17,399
Yeah, now that we know,
you'll be our contact down in Atlantic City.

520
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:21,111
Play your cards right, you can buy a Packard
for every day in the week.

521
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:27,826
- Tomorrow late, we'll send trucks.
- The money, too.

522
00:41:35,668 --> 00:41:38,378
- What about Nucky?
- Fuck him.

523
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,257
By which he means, you're under the wing
of Arnold Rothstein now.

524
00:41:42,342 --> 00:41:44,885
New York Life don't offer
protection that good.

525
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:48,680
One more thing.

526
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:54,645
How do you know I drive a Packard?

527
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:20,170
I stopped by the hospital.
They said you'd already left.

528
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:22,881
He's sleeping. They gave him morphine.

529
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:27,135
Five broken ribs, his nose, a fractured jaw.

530
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:30,597
I'm so sorry, Mary.

531
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:33,183
- It's not your fault. It's mine.
- Yours?

532
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:36,103
I should have left him months ago.
I don't love him.

533
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:39,022
This never would have happened.

534
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:42,192
It's not that easy.

535
00:43:05,425 --> 00:43:07,259
I just can't bear it anymore.

536
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,053
- Has he hurt you?
- No,

537
00:43:10,263 --> 00:43:11,638
not yet.

538
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:15,434
But he's not the same person I knew.

539
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:20,230
Come away with me. You and Tommy.

540
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:24,568
- Where?
- To Paris.

541
00:43:28,865 --> 00:43:30,991
- What about Robert?
- He'll be fine.

542
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:35,829
He'll recover from his injuries
and move on with his life.

543
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,918
- Jimmy will never let me go.
- He'll never know where to find us.

544
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:46,423
Imagine Tommy growing up along the Seine,
speaking French.

545
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:49,092
He'd be nothing like his father.

546
00:43:50,553 --> 00:43:52,220
Or any of them.

547
00:43:52,305 --> 00:43:55,098
Isadora Duncan has a school on Rue Danton.

548
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:57,642
The children wear Grecian tunics.

549
00:43:57,894 --> 00:43:59,811
She inspires them to find their muses

550
00:43:59,979 --> 00:44:01,938
and free their spirits.

551
00:44:04,317 --> 00:44:06,860
There's a ship leaving once a month.

552
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,784
Nous devons aller à Paris.

553
00:44:15,078 --> 00:44:16,286
Say it.

554
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,955
What does it mean?

555
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,793
We must go to Paris.

556
00:44:29,842 --> 00:44:34,429
Nous devons aller à Paris.

557
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:41,436
And so we must.

558
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,036
Thank you, Deputy Halloran.

559
00:44:58,287 --> 00:45:01,081
Could be Sheriff Halloran, come November.

560
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,750
If Eli's not better.

561
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:35,699
The children are asleep
and Mrs. Charlton just left.

562
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,577
No trouble, I take it?

563
00:45:38,744 --> 00:45:40,871
No. They're very obedient.

564
00:45:49,255 --> 00:45:51,381
To guard against intruders.

565
00:45:53,259 --> 00:45:54,634
Mr. Harrow,

566
00:45:57,096 --> 00:45:59,264
I feel I owe you an apology.

567
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:06,730
When you first came here to guard us,
I treated you harshly.

568
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,692
The truth is your affliction frightened me.

569
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,737
Mmm.

570
00:46:14,197 --> 00:46:16,531
People find it disconcerting.

571
00:46:19,827 --> 00:46:21,953
It's unfair, and I'm sorry.

572
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:27,167
We should judge the person on the inside.

573
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,214
I can't do that myself.

574
00:46:34,217 --> 00:46:36,468
So why should you be able to?

575
00:46:39,055 --> 00:46:42,015
Sometimes I forget what I look like.

576
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:46,895
Then I pass a mirror and I remember.

577
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:52,150
I stare sometimes at my face

578
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:55,862
and I can't recall

579
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,907
who I was before.

580
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:40,365
What'll you have?

581
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,038
Whiskey.

582
00:48:18,487 --> 00:48:19,696
Again.

583
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:06,785
May I join you?

584
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:09,079
Sure.

585
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:11,414
Why not?

586
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:19,172
Cigarette?

587
00:49:56,836 --> 00:49:58,712
What's your name, handsome?

588
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,132
Nelson.

589
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,929
I could use another drink, Nelson.

590
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:35,457
This here is Mr. Meyer Lansky.

591
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:39,169
Say hello to Nucky Thompson.

592
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,047
How do you do?

593
00:50:45,593 --> 00:50:47,343
We've already met, actually.

594
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:50,096
You shot at me on the Boardwalk.

595
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:52,307
You're confusing me with somebody else.

596
00:50:53,058 --> 00:50:55,977
There's another dago walking around
with dog shit on his face?

597
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,613
What happened?
You were supposed to make a deal.

598
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:10,533
Why didn't you tell me
these the motherfuckers that lynched my boy?

599
00:51:10,743 --> 00:51:14,871
- Because I hadn't confirmed it.
- I got all the confirmation I need.

600
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:19,459
There are four more brothers, Chalky,
plus Luciano.

601
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,252
How are we supposed to get to them now?

602
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:22,921
Mr. Thompson, may I speak with you?

603
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:35,892
I know we've only recently met
and my word doesn't count for much,

604
00:51:36,852 --> 00:51:39,020
but if you could see your way
to letting me go,

605
00:51:39,104 --> 00:51:42,899
I'm quite certain I can work out
an accommodation with Mr. Rothstein.

606
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,485
Mr. Rothstein made his bed.

607
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,445
Now you fellows can die in it.

608
00:51:47,947 --> 00:51:49,697
Tough talk
when he ain't in the room, right?

609
00:51:50,032 --> 00:51:51,366
What'd you say?

610
00:51:51,492 --> 00:51:53,284
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you heard me.

611
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:56,579
What I said was you, Mr. Thompson
and this coon here

612
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,248
could all go fuck each other.

613
00:51:58,749 --> 00:51:59,916
Right.

614
00:52:05,965 --> 00:52:08,258
Fucking tough guy.
You gonna shoot me for mouthing off?

615
00:52:08,551 --> 00:52:11,261
I wasn't going to,
but you kind of talked me into it.

616
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,944
Anybody else?

617
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,821
Jesus Christ.

618
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:32,615
What do we do with him?

619
00:52:33,742 --> 00:52:37,120
Leave him at the dump
with the rest of the garbage.

620
00:52:39,415 --> 00:52:41,332
My brothers come back,

621
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:46,129
they're gonna string you up higher
than they did that other fucking coon.

622
00:53:54,782 --> 00:53:56,324
You can go now.

623
00:53:57,117 --> 00:54:00,787
And please, tell Mr. Rothstein
what you saw here tonight.

624
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,222
Fuck me.

625
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,391
Fuck me, daddy.

626
00:56:13,295 --> 00:56:14,879
What time is it?

627
00:56:16,048 --> 00:56:17,840
It's late. What are you doing up?

628
00:56:19,301 --> 00:56:20,927
I couldn't sleep.

629
00:56:23,263 --> 00:56:25,556
I had business downtown.
I would have called.

630
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:27,767
Business?

631
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:32,146
Plotting our strategy for the election.

632
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,364
You did very well today

633
00:56:42,116 --> 00:56:43,616
with your speech.

634
00:56:44,993 --> 00:56:46,869
You should get some rest.

635
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:56,504
You had those ladies eating out of your hand.

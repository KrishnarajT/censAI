2
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:12,046
Six minutes and 30 seconds.

3
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:14,257
Is it meant to take this long?

4
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:17,176
Not as far as I'm concerned.

5
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:18,845
Get his brother!

6
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:21,514
What's with you?

7
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:24,350
Makes me nervous is all.

8
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,435
You're not the one tied up, baby.

9
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,118
Bravo!

10
00:02:58,135 --> 00:02:59,594
You're off somewhere again.

11
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:02,805
Was I? Sorry.

12
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,894
Thinking about what?

13
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,856
I don't know if I'm thinking about anything.

14
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,524
You don't know if you were thinking?

15
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:16,027
Isn't that possible?

16
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:30,666
Hello.

17
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:34,670
What do you want me to do about it?

18
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,176
Okay. Okay.

19
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,054
I'm doing this for you.

20
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:46,515
Tomorrow. All right. Bye.

21
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,403
It was my mother.

22
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:04,867
My father's dying.

23
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:23,552
You're quite adept with those.

24
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,846
It's easy once you get the hang of it.

25
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,390
And when did that occur?

26
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,601
- What?
- How did you get the hang of it?

27
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:34,188
I was a clerk for an importer on White Street,

28
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:39,443
Black & Geddes in Manhattan.
Ate in Chinatown a lot.

29
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,571
- It was cheap.
- You craved more excitement,

30
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,990
joined the Bureau.

31
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:46,575
- I suppose.
- And you found it, didn't you,

32
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,120
in mortal combat with our witness?

33
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,331
I don't really like to talk about it, sir.

34
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,750
Self-defense in the line of duty is no crime.

35
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:56,502
I know. It's just...

36
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:00,715
I wish it'd turned out differently.

37
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,341
With you dead instead of him?

38
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:03,634
Of course not.

39
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:08,931
He set upon you unexpectedly,

40
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,727
under the pretense of his need to micturate.

41
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:16,355
Assaulted you with a stone.

42
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,190
That's right.

43
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,234
- And you shot him?
- I had to.

44
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:23,195
- In the forehead?
- The chest.

45
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,739
He hit you in the forehead?

46
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,365
Yes.

47
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,034
Hmm.

48
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:40,629
So he was facing you
while he unsheathed himself.

49
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:46,427
And yet he had a stone that you did not see

50
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,387
until he hit you with it.

51
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:52,099
He grabbed for it, I don't know. He scrambled.

52
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,644
It all happened so quickly.

53
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:02,234
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

54
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,406
The thought of what ingredients
might constitute this filth repulses me.

55
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:34,350
Where is it?

56
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:39,772
Look.

57
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:43,609
- Bravo.
- I didn't feel a thing.

58
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:47,113
I knew you were misleading me,
yet you managed it anyway.

59
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,865
Deception requires complicity,
however subconscious.

60
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,034
We want to be deceived.

61
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,244
Do I have to give it back?

62
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:56,288
I'm a magician, Miss, not a thief.

63
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:58,874
There's an excuse
that might come in handy someday.

64
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:01,544
Thank you.

65
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:08,300
I saw your brother
do that straitjacket gag once.

66
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,010
Hanging from the top of the garden pier.

67
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,680
Five feet or 50, the principle is the same.

68
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,015
Until the rope breaks.

69
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,809
Erik, Houdini as you know him,

70
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:19,145
used to do that escape behind the ghost box,

71
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,021
where no one could see him.

72
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:22,606
Playing it out in the open was my idea.

73
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:24,483
Oh, yes. Well, that's much better.

74
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,903
And the Milk Can Escape,
my innovation as well.

75
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,910
It's no small feat for a grown man
to slip himself inside a tin container.

76
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:36,495
Try a corset and heels.

77
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:41,292
I'm sure Mr. Hardeen has had occasion
to help many women escape from those.

78
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,085
The most challenging trick of all.

79
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,088
Jesus Christ!

80
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:49,258
Doesn't anybody here
read a goddamn newspaper?

81
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,427
I do.

82
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:52,845
Then you know I'm fucking ruined.

83
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:54,388
There are ladies present, sir.

84
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:57,099
I don't give a cunt's hair, you fucking boob.

85
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:59,518
My investment.

86
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:03,772
The Italian fellow I told you about
up in Boston, he was arrested.

87
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:05,065
Charles Ponzi?

88
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,943
It was a swindle from start to finish.

89
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:12,948
I was in up to the limit
and he took me like some out-of-town jasper.

90
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:15,117
Every shell game needs a mark.

91
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:18,954
Nobody legit can guarantee
a return like that, Harry.

92
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:20,831
I don't have a nickel.

93
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,626
I'm dead.

94
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,503
I'm sitting here right now, but...

95
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:28,756
I'm dead.

96
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:31,592
You're totally broke?

97
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:33,761
We'll be okay, doll.

98
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,179
Won't we?

99
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:39,475
Sure we will. We'll pull through. You'll see.

100
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,727
You fat, worthless fool.

101
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:43,312
Belle, wait.

102
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,153
Well, what other tricks do you know?

103
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,786
You know I've never sought notoriety.

104
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:02,289
Well, it's about to be seeking you, my friend.

105
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:03,582
Half the team's indicted.

106
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:05,501
These players,

107
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:08,837
Cicotte, Gandil,
where would I have met them?

108
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:11,674
You've met Sport Sullivan.

109
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,968
And Abe Attell, obviously.
They're named, too.

110
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:17,513
Poor Abe.
One too many haymakers to the head.

111
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:20,808
If he hits the mat on this,
he could very well take you with him.

112
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,434
A girl goes to bed with 10 fellows,

113
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,354
who's gonna believe her
when she says the eleventh is the father?

114
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,899
Arnold, I admire your sangfroid,

115
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,111
but I'm not the person you need to convince.

116
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:34,613
You were concerned enough
to retain my services,

117
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:36,615
and I'm telling you now
your concerns were justified.

118
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,951
What do you propose?

119
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,370
Come here, to Chicago.

120
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,455
Into the lion's den?

121
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,166
Yes. But before you do that,

122
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,627
I want you to think hard
about who in this town

123
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,337
is willing to do you a favor.

124
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:13,777
Commodore, sir.

125
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:15,029
Jesus.

126
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:18,490
What is it?

127
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:20,326
Your visitor, he's here.

128
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,036
Oh.

129
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,079
Good.

130
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:27,249
Show him in.

131
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:44,933
There's the boy.

132
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,479
May I get you something, sir?

133
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:50,731
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

134
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:52,441
Nonsense. Get him a drink.

135
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:56,653
No, no, you go on. I'll do it.

136
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:04,453
Leave that there, for Christ's sake.

137
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,500
So...

138
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:12,669
Look at you.

139
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,464
A proper gentleman.

140
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:19,093
My mother raised me well.

141
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:21,804
Biscuit?

142
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:33,524
Yeah, he passed last night.

143
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:38,654
Whimpering, vomiting,
couldn't find a place to settle.

144
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,574
I couldn't do a damn thing.

145
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:45,536
It's a fucking dog.

146
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:47,788
You're a stony little bastard.

147
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:50,582
I'm what time and circumstance
have made me.

148
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:53,544
Your mother keeps me informed.

149
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:55,379
Those must be pleasant conversations.

150
00:11:56,673 --> 00:12:00,676
You have no concept of the ways
that people can be close.

151
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:05,139
I have a pretty good idea.
You were 54. She was 13.

152
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:09,893
You'd have done the same thing.

153
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:11,437
You don't know me very well.

154
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:14,523
Oh, I know you backwards and forwards.

155
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:18,152
You want anything
you can lay your hands on,

156
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:21,155
and nothing's gonna stop you from getting it.

157
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,701
I expect nothing less from my son, though.

158
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:32,124
This reunion over?

159
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:35,210
I'm dying, boy.

160
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:41,925
Well, then I will call you a priest.

161
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,053
You know what this town was
before I came here?

162
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:49,892
A fucking swamp.

163
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,146
Sand blowing through
shitty boarding houses.

164
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:56,231
Nobody wanted to come here.

165
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,401
But I drained that swamp.

166
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:04,406
I paved those streets. I put up those hotels.

167
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,702
I made this fucking city.

168
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:11,747
You and your giant blue ox, right?

169
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:13,373
Don't sass me, boy.

170
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,336
I'm just trying to tell you something.

171
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:20,255
What are you trying to tell me?

172
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,136
The wrong man is running this town.

173
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,940
- Where are you going?
- I don't feel well.

174
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:10,055
He knows I'm unhappy,
but he'd never dream I'd leave.

175
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,099
Neither would Robert.

176
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:15,227
Pack lightly.
One suitcase for you and Tommy both.

177
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:17,896
We can buy whatever we need
once we're abroad.

178
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,565
I'd like a fresh start anyway.

179
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:23,902
The man from Cunard says
we're to be at the dock an hour early.

180
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,696
We'll meet here, and then go to...

181
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,155
God damn it!

182
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:29,533
Dearest?

183
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:31,618
Hello?

184
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,747
I'm helpless on these damned things.

185
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,333
I spilled developer on my trousers.

186
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:40,627
- It's all over the floor.
- I'll get it later. Sit.

187
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:56,602
I'll see you later, Mary.

188
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:06,612
What were you two conspiring about?

189
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:08,947
What?

190
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:11,491
I heard hushed voices.

191
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,702
Oh. Just girl talk.

192
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:17,706
Well, you do like your little games, don't you?

193
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,792
You seem to enjoy them yourself.

194
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,545
Very wicked, my love.

195
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:40,896
Where are you calling from?

196
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,064
The lobby.

197
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:44,107
Are you out of your fucking mind?

198
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,902
I couldn't call from the post office.
It wasn't safe.

199
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:48,570
You were cleared, weren't you?

200
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,405
There's nothing he can do.

201
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:52,074
He's not letting go of this.

202
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:54,701
Then give him something he can't argue with.

203
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:55,869
Like what?

204
00:15:58,331 --> 00:15:59,831
You're a Prohi, aren't you?

205
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,250
- Go find bootleggers.
- Any suggestions?

206
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:07,005
Head out toward Mays Landing,
along the Black Horse.

207
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,093
I wouldn't be surprised if there was
a major illegal distillery operating there.

208
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,219
How far?

209
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:13,720
You want me to make the arrest, too?

210
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:17,432
Just past mile marker 14, on the left.

211
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:20,060
Don't get spooked, kid.

212
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,728
No, sir.

213
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,940
Now go look like a hero,
and let's not talk again.

214
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,033
Yes, you're standing there.

215
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:39,287
A lady in distress.

216
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:41,915
That son of a bitch.

217
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,293
Annabelle, you can tell me whatever you want,

218
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:48,547
but don't scream, don't cry
and don't throw anything.

219
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:59,141
I had money under the floorboards.

220
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:01,435
Harry took it all.

221
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,270
How much?

222
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:05,939
$3,682.

223
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:09,818
I counted it every night.

224
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:12,028
And you want me to have him arrested.

225
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:13,488
I sure as hell do.

226
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,824
To get back the money you lifted from him.

227
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,285
I worked my tail off for it.

228
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,497
My little girl.

229
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,878
You said you wouldn't do this.

230
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:43,059
This will see you through the summer.

231
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:48,857
Come on, let's just skip to the part
where you say you'll do anything for me.

232
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,400
Well, I would.

233
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:54,029
Draw the curtains, and I'll do it right now.

234
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:56,740
What happened to the tears?

235
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,827
Ride me like you used to
and I'll soak the pillow through.

236
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:05,373
I'll keep that one in my pocket.

237
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,210
And he will, you know.

238
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:15,884
Mr. Thompson's gift is
to never forget who owes him what.

239
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:18,303
It's generally a good principle.

240
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:21,890
Harry found her stash and did a bunk.

241
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:22,974
I know.

242
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:26,645
Did you mention
I already gave you $50 myself?

243
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:29,064
I guess we're both a soft touch.

244
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,739
Thanks for helping a girl out.

245
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:47,541
I thought you might like to hear,

246
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:51,336
the League of Women Voters
is going to formally endorse Mr. Bader.

247
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:55,090
- That's wonderful.
- Then I'm glad to have been of use to you.

248
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,518
How did he look?

249
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:10,647
Looks like he's dying.

250
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,066
He smelled like garlic.

251
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:18,405
He says you two see each other.

252
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,284
We began keeping in touch.

253
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:25,620
We have you in common, after all.

254
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:30,292
When you enlisted, he called me.
He was very concerned.

255
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:35,297
He lost his brother at the Battle of Vicksburg.

256
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:37,591
Well, he needn't have worried.

257
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:39,885
I told him you would come back.

258
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:44,139
Lady Jean told me so.

259
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,808
The fortune-teller? Ma, Jesus.

260
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:48,643
She was right, wasn't she?

261
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:51,980
There's rhubarb pie.

262
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,568
You were 13 years old.

263
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:02,115
You were by yourself, and you had me.

264
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:06,328
I wasn't completely alone.

265
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,831
Nucky Thompson was looking after us.

266
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,044
And why was he doing that?

267
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:17,422
He was the sheriff.

268
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:20,091
He worked for your father and...

269
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:25,555
You remember this?

270
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:33,271
May Day, 1897.

271
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:37,025
I was one of King Neptune's consorts.

272
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:42,697
Your father saw me.

273
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:47,243
And Nucky worked for him,
and later that day...

274
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:49,579
Well, that night, really.

275
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:51,873
Nucky brought me to him

276
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:56,336
because that was one of the things
he did for the Commodore.

277
00:20:58,005 --> 00:21:01,132
And we proceeded in that fashion
for some time.

278
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:08,431
A pimp.

279
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:13,311
An ambitious young man

280
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:15,480
who wanted to get ahead.

281
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:18,900
He had a wife.

282
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:21,361
He wanted to start a family.

283
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:22,946
And that makes it okay?

284
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,532
You remember Mabel?

285
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:27,993
She was a lovely woman.

286
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:30,578
It's a tragedy.

287
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,377
Nucky has been kind in his way

288
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:40,588
to you and me both.

289
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,220
I suppose the whole affair
has always bothered him.

290
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:52,934
Do you remember how long this used to be?

291
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:55,812
Mmm.

292
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:03,987
I told the doctor that I'd meet him
at your father's house.

293
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:09,492
No one deserves to die alone.

294
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:37,103
That was the marker a little ways back.

295
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,938
It should be around here somewhere.

296
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:42,817
And this anonymous source

297
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:45,820
wouldn't have any reason to lie?

298
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:57,415
You think maybe there's a...

299
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,833
Quiet.

300
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:31,032
What are they doing here?

301
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,409
Now we ain't doing nothing wrong here.

302
00:23:34,787 --> 00:23:35,787
Gentlemen.

303
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:41,167
Special Agent Van Alden
with the Bureau of Internal Revenue.

304
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:44,754
What's going on here?

305
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:49,509
Just strengthening the Lord's army,
one lost soul at a time.

306
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:53,012
I call it "the week of miracles."

307
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:56,641
"And John did baptize in the wilderness."

308
00:23:58,352 --> 00:24:01,396
Deacon Cuffy,
Shiloh Baptist Church of Atlantic City.

309
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:04,190
As far as I know, we are breaking no laws, sir.

310
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:06,901
You think Christ hears you
in this forsaken place?

311
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:08,903
Jesus is a wonder worker, sir.

312
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:11,030
He hears everybody everywhere.

313
00:24:12,908 --> 00:24:14,659
- From the hollows to the hills.
- Yes, Lord.

314
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:16,161
Just words, Deacon.

315
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,329
No, sir. It's the gospel.

316
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:20,748
And this gospel is truth.

317
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:22,876
Turn from it however you may,

318
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,087
but every road leads to a reckoning.

319
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:28,381
That is what you believe?

320
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:29,757
That's what I know.

321
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,510
And I'll stake my place
in the kingdom upon it.

322
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:34,053
- Oh, Lord.
- Praise Jesus.

323
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:35,138
Yes, Lord.

324
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:36,931
Then carry on.

325
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:42,061
He that believeth

326
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:44,439
and is baptized

327
00:24:45,274 --> 00:24:46,524
shall be saved.

328
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,610
- Amen.
- Right now.

329
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:50,987
But he that believeth not

330
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:56,868
shall be condemned to the fires of damnation!

331
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:58,786
Shouldn't we be looking for that still?

332
00:24:58,871 --> 00:25:01,789
Your people don't believe in heaven, do they?

333
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:03,082
My people?

334
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:05,710
Don't be glib. The Jews.

335
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:08,671
No, not exactly.

336
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:10,298
Rise up.

337
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:12,300
Rise up, brothers and sisters.

338
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:13,801
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

339
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:16,054
Sir, I know you're under a lot of strain...

340
00:25:16,972 --> 00:25:20,308
But if you don't believe in heaven,
then how can you conceive of hell?

341
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:22,977
- Surrender yourselves.
- Yes, yes.

342
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,772
And rid yourselves of worldly sins.

343
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:27,899
- Hallelujah.
- And be set free,

344
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:30,068
unshackled,

345
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:35,406
free to do the Lord's work.

346
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:37,784
Amen. Amen.

347
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:38,993
Amen.

348
00:25:39,578 --> 00:25:43,289
Let any man or woman with sin in their heart

349
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:45,250
come forward

350
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:52,257
to have that sin washed away
by the grace of Jesus Christ Almighty.

351
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:56,761
- Jesus Christ.
- Yes, yes.

352
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:20,368
Are you all right?

353
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:24,831
I am.

354
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:27,750
The question is, are you?

355
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,073
Eat, dear.

356
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:01,784
The angel of death.

357
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,830
I knew you would be beautiful.

358
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:13,087
He's quite jaundiced.

359
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:15,506
Has he urinated?

360
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:18,176
That chamber pot been empty for days.

361
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:21,679
There's something wrong
with every organ in his body.

362
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:29,771
- I'd like to run some tests.
- Is that really necessary?

363
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:32,315
Just let me die, damn it.

364
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,526
The Commodore don't like to be
fussed with, Doctor.

365
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:40,281
I just need a hair sample.

366
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:43,951
No. What are you doing?

367
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:45,119
- It's all right.
- No.

368
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:46,788
- Just a little piece of...
- No.

369
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:48,539
- Look.
- It's okay.

370
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:50,875
- No, he's trying to kill me.
- He's not trying to kill you, just...

371
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,211
- He's trying to kill me.
- Relax. Relax.

372
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:54,629
He's trying to help you.

373
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:55,880
Easy.

374
00:27:58,926 --> 00:27:59,926
He's trying to help you.

375
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,094
Yes.

376
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:05,139
Okay? Relax.

377
00:28:05,974 --> 00:28:09,185
It's all right.
I'll just take a lock from the back here.

378
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:13,147
You're okay. You're okay.

379
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:24,534
You're a good son.

380
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:44,595
Have you eaten anything?

381
00:28:48,183 --> 00:28:50,226
Somebody has to stay here for him.

382
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,311
I'll stay with him tonight.

383
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,022
So what's the point
of this gathering?

384
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:39,484
We don't have to go if you don't want to.

385
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:43,029
Most of these women were against suffrage
in the first place.

386
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,323
Not too big on immigrants either.

387
00:29:45,824 --> 00:29:48,117
How did their own ancestors get here?

388
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:50,036
The Daughters of the American Revolution?

389
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,663
Why, they grew in the ground like pumpkins

390
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:56,083
and marched off with Washington
to Valley Forge.

391
00:29:58,253 --> 00:30:00,254
I'll do what's required of me.

392
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:03,716
Not really the right answer.

393
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:06,761
What answer would you prefer?

394
00:30:09,932 --> 00:30:11,432
What you saw...

395
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:17,438
What you thought you saw
in my office yesterday

396
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:19,023
couldn't have been more innocent.

397
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:22,985
Annabelle is far from innocent.

398
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:25,738
And I daresay
you've some experience yourself.

399
00:30:25,822 --> 00:30:28,032
We had a relationship years ago.

400
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:30,701
It meant nothing.

401
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:32,620
I was helping her, Margaret. That's all.

402
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:34,664
The way you helped me?

403
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:36,457
I thought she was your friend.

404
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:40,294
So you wouldn't fuck her?

405
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,257
That language does not become you.

406
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:45,508
Yes.

407
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:49,345
- You'd rather I be demure.
- I'd rather you be rational.

408
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:50,805
Meaning what?

409
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:54,559
That I say nothing about what I see,
what I hear?

410
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:57,186
What have you heard?

411
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:00,606
That you are capable of anything.

412
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:02,817
And who told you that?

413
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:04,652
Agent Van Alden,

414
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:07,196
while you were out campaigning.

415
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:10,908
Well, if you didn't tell me about it,
it couldn't have been very upsetting.

416
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:14,203
It made me sick to my stomach.

417
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,331
This whole arrangement does.

418
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:18,666
What arrangement?

419
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:23,129
That I'm to accept what you tell me
and ask nothing more.

420
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,631
That I aid you in the business you conduct

421
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:28,551
and pretend I don't know
what that business is.

422
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:32,221
I don't recall you ever saying no
to anything I put in front of you.

423
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:34,098
You make a little noise every now and then

424
00:31:34,182 --> 00:31:36,517
to remind me what a good person you are.

425
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:39,478
But a good person
wouldn't be here right now.

426
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:42,106
You don't know what I am.

427
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:43,941
I don't?

428
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:53,743
This is what you do.

429
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:58,289
After you lie down with me, you go in there,
wash your body with this poison,

430
00:31:58,373 --> 00:31:59,373
like any whore.

431
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:01,792
I won't have another child.

432
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:04,545
- By me?
- By any man.

433
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:06,213
That's not your right to decide.

434
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:08,633
Why should you care? We're not married.

435
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:13,262
Do you expect that I would give you,
what, an heir?

436
00:32:13,555 --> 00:32:14,972
Is that what you want me for?

437
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:16,349
I thought you needed saving.

438
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,017
And that's why you chose my husband.

439
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:19,644
What are you talking about?

440
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:22,605
You knew nothing of him until I came to you.

441
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,400
What purpose did it serve
to make me a widow?

442
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:27,777
You need to be careful now.

443
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:30,488
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm advising you.

444
00:32:30,572 --> 00:32:32,323
Whatever idea you've gotten into your head...

445
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:34,784
Your brother came to me with money.

446
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:37,161
- To help you.
- To keep me quiet.

447
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,081
Well, you have been, haven't you?

448
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:43,209
Not a word about this man who beat you,

449
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:45,961
who murdered the baby you were carrying,

450
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:48,756
who you loved so very much.

451
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:52,343
I have not lost one second of sleep
over what was done,

452
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:53,636
and neither have you.

453
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:02,770
You won't be needing that anymore, will you?

454
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:08,609
Sir.

455
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:11,737
- Yes?
- Sir, you got a visitor.

456
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:13,948
Thank you.

457
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:21,497
How is your father?

458
00:33:21,957 --> 00:33:23,791
He's on his way out.

459
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:26,335
Mmm. I'm sorry.

460
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:27,628
Honestly,

461
00:33:28,922 --> 00:33:30,631
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

462
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:32,967
You're here for your mother.

463
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:35,177
- It's your duty.
- Yeah.

464
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:38,472
Chalky, Mr. White,

465
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:41,726
heard back from his man in Philadelphia.

466
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:43,060
Any sign of them?

467
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:45,646
Mrs. D'Alessio, the mother, is there,

468
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:49,150
the sisters and another brother.

469
00:33:49,985 --> 00:33:50,985
Which one?

470
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:52,194
Adrian.

471
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,446
Never heard of him.

472
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,572
He's a dentist.

473
00:33:58,326 --> 00:34:00,202
- I could go there.
- Where?

474
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:01,662
To Philadelphia.

475
00:34:01,997 --> 00:34:04,832
What good is that?
They're lying low somewhere else.

476
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,169
I would kill the mother.

477
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:11,630
The sisters.

478
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:14,091
And the dentist.

479
00:34:15,427 --> 00:34:17,928
That would make them stick their heads up.

480
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:22,516
Did you run your tests?

481
00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:24,059
Yes.

482
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:28,230
I have some information.

483
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:31,400
We'll talk that over later, Richard.

484
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:40,785
We need to speak frankly.

485
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:42,328
Okay.

486
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:43,954
Are you the next of kin?

487
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:47,541
I'm pretty sure I'm not in the will,
if that's what you mean.

488
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:49,627
Who else stands to gain
from your father's death?

489
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:51,962
What are you talking about?

490
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:53,964
The tests are pretty crude,

491
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:57,426
but there's enough arsenic in his body
to take down a hippo.

492
00:35:00,055 --> 00:35:01,639
I don't want to.

493
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,891
Yes, you do. You said so.

494
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,811
We're going sailing, remember?

495
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:08,813
You, me, Aunt Mary,

496
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:11,565
over the ocean to Paris.

497
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:12,983
Is Daddy coming?

498
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:15,402
No.

499
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,821
How come?

500
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,700
Daddy's already been there,
and he didn't like it.

501
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:24,453
Come on, hurry.

502
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:28,666
Aunt Mary is waiting.

503
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,085
Can Gillian come?

504
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,508
No. She doesn't like Paris, either.

505
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:51,689
Come on. Let's go meet Aunt Mary.

506
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:20,676
What's he do all day?

507
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:23,345
Sits there. He's upset about the house.

508
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:26,265
It's a miracle it didn't happen sooner.

509
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:31,520
The place was a firetrap.

510
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,276
So, your lady friend.

511
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:40,654
Tell me about this row.

512
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:42,448
It got very ugly.

513
00:36:43,408 --> 00:36:45,409
I fight with June all the time.

514
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:48,454
We go out to the shed
to make sure the kids don't hear.

515
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:51,498
The mouth on her... You'd be surprised.

516
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,250
She knows, Eli.

517
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:55,461
She suspects, you mean.

518
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:57,838
How could she know?

519
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:07,514
You didn't tell her?

520
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:09,558
I didn't deny it either.

521
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:10,851
What the fuck were you thinking?

522
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:13,979
That I wanted to hurt her.

523
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:15,522
What do you think these are for?

524
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:17,107
That's not who I am.

525
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:18,442
It isn't?

526
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:20,527
Who told me to get rid of her husband?

527
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:22,321
He deserved it.

528
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:23,530
Deserved?

529
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:25,407
Who the fuck are you?

530
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:28,202
Leave that shit to God
and look after business.

531
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:30,079
She starts shooting her mouth off...

532
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:31,956
- She won't.
- How do you know?

533
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,041
How do you know anything?

534
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,418
I got a bullet in my gut
from what you don't know.

535
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:38,671
- Calm down, Eli.
- You need to wake up!

536
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:40,881
Fletcher gets elected,

537
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:43,467
and he is this close, brother.

538
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:44,510
You're telling me?

539
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:47,554
They are coming after us with pickaxes.

540
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:49,974
- This fucking woman...
- Margaret.

541
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:52,434
This woman is a liability

542
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:56,271
that you created, because, why?

543
00:37:56,606 --> 00:37:58,607
She'll absolve you
of all the sinful shit on your hands?

544
00:37:58,692 --> 00:38:00,067
- Oh, stop.
- What?

545
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:01,443
That's how you think.

546
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:02,987
I didn't ask for your insights.

547
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:04,571
This is my life on the line!

548
00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:06,949
I got eight kids.

549
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:09,410
You waltz around town like it's a circus,

550
00:38:10,036 --> 00:38:13,247
getting your ass kissed,
the king of the freak show.

551
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:15,332
Nobody cares about you.

552
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,668
They only care about what you can give them.

553
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:19,336
And that includes your Irish chippie

554
00:38:19,504 --> 00:38:22,006
who you just handed a blank check.

555
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,926
You know, it's too bad
you didn't see Hardeen the other night.

556
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:27,803
What?

557
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,847
It's an entertaining act.

558
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:33,517
But if he wasn't Houdini's brother,
nobody'd give a fuck.

559
00:38:42,444 --> 00:38:43,610
Hey.

560
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:46,113
How is he?

561
00:38:46,698 --> 00:38:49,116
Well, he made it through another night.

562
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,119
I'm surprised.

563
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,583
You want some coffee?

564
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:05,132
How much money do you think he has?

565
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:06,925
Your father?

566
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:09,094
I have no idea.

567
00:39:10,722 --> 00:39:12,056
But it's enough

568
00:39:13,475 --> 00:39:15,601
to live comfortably, that's for sure.

569
00:39:16,644 --> 00:39:18,270
I should hope so.

570
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:21,231
It certainly doesn't seem as if he's wanting.

571
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:23,067
No, it certainly doesn't.

572
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,830
Have you talked about
what would happen if he dies?

573
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,502
I don't know what you mean.

574
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:46,799
He said you two were close.

575
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:50,177
Well, "close" is a relative term.

576
00:39:53,306 --> 00:39:56,350
I'm not quite sure
what you're getting at, sweetie.

577
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:59,019
Look, Ma,

578
00:39:59,354 --> 00:40:01,688
it's fine with me, it really is.

579
00:40:02,273 --> 00:40:04,108
Whatever you want to do.

580
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:08,195
The other day I ate a cookie at his house
and it made me vomit.

581
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:09,905
And this morning,

582
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:11,990
I found this.

583
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:16,370
Tucked down, hidden in his rubbish pail

584
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:19,998
in the kitchen.

585
00:40:24,504 --> 00:40:26,964
"Fifty bucks?" the fellow says.

586
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:31,718
"Peter Stuyvesant paid only $24
for the entire island of Manhattan."

587
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:33,887
"Yeah," the whore replies,

588
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:37,099
"But Manhattan just lays there."

589
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:41,145
Peter Minuit.

590
00:40:42,021 --> 00:40:43,856
- What?
- Peter Minuit bought Manhattan.

591
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:45,357
Okay.

592
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:47,234
Get your fucking facts straight.

593
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:49,987
- In a joke?
- You think it's funny?

594
00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:52,156
That's the attitude,

595
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:54,908
the lack of attention to detail,
that's fucking killing us.

596
00:40:55,326 --> 00:40:56,326
I'm sorry, Nuck.

597
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:57,744
This is the toughest election in our lifetimes,

598
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:59,204
and you're standing here telling jokes.

599
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:01,540
I'm sorry, Nuck. We were talking...

600
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:03,167
You think Fletcher's over there
at the Democratic Club

601
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:04,960
doing a fucking vaudeville routine?

602
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,754
Well, he's not. He's out there shaking hands,

603
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,924
trying to steal the election
out from under our goddamn noses.

604
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,926
Come on, Nuck. The Democrats?

605
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:14,469
The people know who they can trust.

606
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:16,889
The people want reform, women especially.

607
00:41:17,515 --> 00:41:21,643
You've seen the papers, "Corruption,
violence, gunplay on the Boardwalk."

608
00:41:23,897 --> 00:41:25,480
I'm making a change.

609
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:28,358
We have a plan to meet the future head-on.

610
00:41:28,443 --> 00:41:30,527
And Ed Bader here will be a big part of that.

611
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:32,029
But he can't do it alone.

612
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:35,532
He'll need a strong arm
if he's going to be swinging for the fences.

613
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:38,118
A strong arm and clean record.

614
00:41:38,578 --> 00:41:42,372
That's why, with great regret
and much gratitude for years of service,

615
00:41:42,457 --> 00:41:44,166
I have this day accepted the resignation

616
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,628
of my brother Elias Thompson
for the office of Sheriff.

617
00:41:48,296 --> 00:41:50,255
- Eli's out?
- What the hell's going on, Nuck?

618
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,381
I just told you.

619
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:52,799
Well, yeah, but...

620
00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:56,511
Deputy Halloran, the star is yours to wear,
if you'll honor us so.

621
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:00,557
Well, sure I will.

622
00:42:02,435 --> 00:42:03,936
Thanks, Nucky.

623
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,562
I won't let you down.

624
00:42:05,647 --> 00:42:07,522
Then God bless us all.

625
00:42:08,149 --> 00:42:10,317
And good luck on election day.

626
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:17,407
- Good luck, Halloran.
- How about that?

627
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,327
Mr. Harrow is on the phone.

628
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:24,498
Sheriff now.

629
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,167
Hey, fellas! Fellas, you wanna race?

630
00:42:27,252 --> 00:42:28,418
I'll race you all the way to the pier.

631
00:42:28,503 --> 00:42:30,963
- Yeah, come on.
- Come on, hurry up. Come on, let's go.

632
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:56,989
How do?

633
00:42:57,782 --> 00:42:58,949
Who are you?

634
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:00,033
Donald Flance.

635
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:02,035
I manage the property.

636
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:05,205
Where are the Dittrichs?

637
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,540
The photographer?

638
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:09,835
Snuck out yesterday, dead of night.

639
00:43:13,172 --> 00:43:14,381
What about his wife?

640
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:15,507
Wife?

641
00:43:16,175 --> 00:43:20,095
If that's who she was,
I guess she went with him.

642
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:27,102
The lease says "broom clean,"
but they couldn't be bothered.

643
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:29,479
Where'd they go?

644
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:30,814
Not sure.

645
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:36,653
The wife was always talking about Paris.

646
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,413
Look, Mommy. Ghosts.

647
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:08,935
I thought you should know,
I'm requesting a transfer.

648
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:12,314
What brings this on?

649
00:44:13,649 --> 00:44:15,108
I have family near Detroit.

650
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,488
And there's a lot of liquor
coming in across the lake from Canada.

651
00:44:20,281 --> 00:44:21,907
I heard they were looking for agents.

652
00:44:23,117 --> 00:44:24,534
Only the best men.

653
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,536
I don't know about that.

654
00:44:26,996 --> 00:44:27,996
Mmm.

655
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:32,834
May I speak freely, sir?

656
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,294
Please do.

657
00:44:36,422 --> 00:44:38,006
I know you don't trust me.

658
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,468
I'm not sure why,
but I'm pretty confident that's the case.

659
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,720
What makes you think that?

660
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:51,144
The incessant questions, the dirty looks,
the insinuations about my religious beliefs.

661
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:55,899
We've been over
the Winslow shooting 50 times, sir.

662
00:44:55,983 --> 00:44:57,526
Because something doesn't sit right.

663
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,903
But it doesn't make sense.
Why would I want him dead?

664
00:45:00,154 --> 00:45:02,989
Temptation knows no rank, Agent Sebso.

665
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:04,991
What's that supposed to mean?

666
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:13,500
I do notice you're wearing new wing tips.

667
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:15,919
They were on discount.
I got them at Driscoll's.

668
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:22,509
This is what I mean.
I don't like what you're implying here, sir.

669
00:45:22,593 --> 00:45:25,846
What you like is none of my concern.

670
00:45:26,514 --> 00:45:27,889
I need men I can trust.

671
00:45:27,974 --> 00:45:31,268
You can trust me, God damn it!
What do I have to do to convince you?

672
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:46,616
I baptize thee in the name of the Father...

673
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:47,701
- Father.
- Yes.

674
00:45:49,537 --> 00:45:50,537
...the Son

675
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,999
and the Holy Ghost.

676
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,417
- Amen.
- Amen.

677
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:56,460
Hallelujah.

678
00:45:56,544 --> 00:45:59,546
In the marvelous expectation
of resurrection

679
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:03,258
and the righteous blessings of eternal life...

680
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:04,843
Deacon Cuffy.

681
00:46:07,138 --> 00:46:10,682
Agent Van Alden
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.

682
00:46:11,392 --> 00:46:14,311
Have you come here
to be accepted into the arms of Christ?

683
00:46:14,896 --> 00:46:16,396
I have never left him, Deacon.

684
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:21,401
Though I have at times turned from his love.

685
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:23,111
You cannot turn from him, sir.

686
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:26,323
Whatsoever the compass point,
he is there beside you.

687
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:28,909
I do know that to be so.

688
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,415
But this man does not.

689
00:46:38,085 --> 00:46:42,756
There is a veil over his eyes, Deacon,
and a darkness in his soul.

690
00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:46,760
Come forward.

691
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:49,012
No, thank you.

692
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,014
Young sir, come forward.

693
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:52,307
No, thank you.

694
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:54,434
Come forward, Mr. Sebso.

695
00:46:55,937 --> 00:46:57,062
I'd really rather not.

696
00:46:57,939 --> 00:47:00,482
You insult these good people
and their beliefs.

697
00:47:00,775 --> 00:47:01,942
They're not my beliefs.

698
00:47:02,068 --> 00:47:04,027
What are you afraid of, Mr. Sebso?

699
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:05,070
I'm not afraid. I...

700
00:47:05,154 --> 00:47:06,905
Then let these waters wash you clean.

701
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:09,157
- Yes.
- He doesn't want to hear all that.

702
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:10,534
Be washed clean, brother.

703
00:47:10,618 --> 00:47:11,618
Go on now.

704
00:47:12,453 --> 00:47:13,870
Be washed in the blood of the lamb.

705
00:47:13,955 --> 00:47:14,955
Lord Jesus.

706
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:18,124
Okay, fine.

707
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:19,376
- Amen.
- Amen.

708
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:20,961
Amen.

709
00:47:22,588 --> 00:47:23,588
Hallelujah.

710
00:47:39,981 --> 00:47:41,773
I just bought those.

711
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:54,119
Any believer may baptize, may he not?

712
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:56,329
That's a matter of some dispute.

713
00:47:56,706 --> 00:47:58,665
Will you permit it here?

714
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:01,585
I will.

715
00:48:14,515 --> 00:48:17,726
Do you accept Jesus as your savior?

716
00:48:19,186 --> 00:48:20,937
Am I supposed to hold my...

717
00:48:23,357 --> 00:48:24,858
Unburden your soul, Mr. Sebso.

718
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,195
Will you confess your sins
and accept Jesus as your savior?

719
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,864
Look, what do you expect me...

720
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:41,041
Confess your sins
and accept Jesus as your savior!

721
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,043
Accept him, accept him.

722
00:48:53,054 --> 00:48:55,889
I ask you once again, Agent Sebso,

723
00:48:56,682 --> 00:49:00,226
will you confess your sins
and accept Jesus as your savior?

724
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:01,770
No, I don't...

725
00:49:11,197 --> 00:49:12,489
This is not a battle, sir.

726
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:13,740
You're wrong, Deacon.

727
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:15,742
It is a battle against the devil himself.

728
00:49:16,577 --> 00:49:19,579
I have seen him abroad
in the daylight and the night!

729
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:22,248
And by God I will force him out!

730
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:57,450
Thou hast fulfilled
the judgment of the wicked!

731
00:50:52,214 --> 00:50:56,843
Last night, when I came, she sent me away.

732
00:50:58,387 --> 00:51:00,013
Did she say why?

733
00:51:01,515 --> 00:51:04,309
Only that she didn't need me.

734
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:10,190
She said that you knew.

735
00:51:11,734 --> 00:51:13,067
And today?

736
00:51:17,323 --> 00:51:20,366
I came at the regular time.

737
00:51:22,036 --> 00:51:23,536
She was there.

738
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:26,039
They had suitcases.

739
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:31,961
She asked me to return some things

740
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,923
to the neighbor across the way.

741
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:39,260
When I came back...

742
00:51:41,096 --> 00:51:42,889
They had disappeared.

743
00:52:11,836 --> 00:52:12,836
Let's get you to bed.

744
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,212
I'm not tired.

745
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:16,047
You're asleep on your feet.

746
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:26,140
- Boo.
- You scared us.

747
00:52:26,934 --> 00:52:28,560
I didn't mean to.

748
00:52:33,774 --> 00:52:35,275
How's your father?

749
00:52:35,776 --> 00:52:37,068
Turns out he's gonna live.

750
00:52:40,656 --> 00:52:41,906
Let me get that for you.

751
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:43,616
- It's all right.
- I got it.

752
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:49,956
I know what you've been up to.

753
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:52,458
No, you don't.

754
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:54,544
Yeah, I do.

755
00:52:54,628 --> 00:52:57,130
You've been at Abe Klein's, haven't you?

756
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:59,257
How do you know that?

757
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:03,303
Because you've got chocolate phosphate
right here.

758
00:53:04,638 --> 00:53:07,390
All right, come on, buddy. Time to go to bed.

759
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,100
No arguments.

760
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:16,983
Did you have fun staying up late?

761
00:53:17,776 --> 00:53:19,360
It's fun, right?

762
00:53:20,821 --> 00:53:23,156
Few years, you and your old pop,

763
00:53:24,408 --> 00:53:26,784
we're gonna be keeping all hours.

764
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:29,495
You'll see. It'll be just us boys.

765
00:53:34,001 --> 00:53:35,084
All right.

766
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:36,836
Come on, lay down.

767
00:53:45,846 --> 00:53:47,347
Mommy's gonna tuck you in.

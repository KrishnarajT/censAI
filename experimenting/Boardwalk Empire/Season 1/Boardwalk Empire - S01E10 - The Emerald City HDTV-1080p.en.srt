2
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,554
I'm sorry. Don't mind. Don't be afraid.

3
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,058
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,726
I won't hurt you.

5
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,730
Mama!

6
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,363
We're on edge here as it is.

7
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,698
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,701
It's not comfortable to sleep with.

9
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,581
Mama!

10
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,507
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,013
He said he had to make water

12
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:06,102
and if I didn't pull over, he'd do it right there,
in his trousers, on the car seat.

13
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,021
- You should have let him.
- Nelson.

14
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,857
I had to go myself, sir.

15
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:15,444
It's almost four hours' drive to Manhattan.
I'd had several cups of coffee.

16
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,283
I stopped the car, relieved myself,

17
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,743
then unlocked Winslow's handcuffs.

18
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,912
In other words, you dispensed with protocol.

19
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,916
To not do so would have meant
unbuttoning his trousers and...

20
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,544
And touching his johnson with your fingers.

21
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,920
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:37,174
So in service to your own modesty,
you ended up killing our witness.

23
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,802
You will not be told again, Nelson.

24
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,266
Nothing in his demeanor led me to believe
that he'd attack me, sir.

25
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,143
The man was a felon.

26
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,233
You got anything else to say?

27
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,568
I know I fouled up,

28
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,821
but killing that prisoner...

29
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,285
It'll haunt me for the rest of my days.

30
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,334
You acted in self-defense.
You've been exonerated.

31
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,883
- Take a week's leave, get some rest.
- Yes, sir.

32
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,093
Thank you, sir.

33
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,138
That is all.

34
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,191
Have you any idea, Nelson,

35
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,402
the embarrassment

36
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,363
this incident has brought
upon the department?

37
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,908
I take full responsibility
for Winslow's death, sir.

38
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,536
That's fine, Nelson, because that's precisely
where I place the blame.

39
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,707
I told you I wanted numbers,
arrests relating to alcohol.

40
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,710
Winslow's confession
is a direct link to Nucky Thompson.

41
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,213
Winslow is dead.
His confession is useless hearsay.

42
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,714
I'll have another crack at Darmody.

43
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,133
Darmody has been released
for lack of evidence.

44
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,469
Thompson's lawyers
are swarming like hornets.

45
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,846
He committed murder
on a direct order from Nucky Thompson.

46
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,141
For God's sakes, man,
you have bungled this from the start!

47
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,239
This is your last chance, Nelson.

48
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,491
One more misstep

49
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,578
and you'll be hunting moonshiners
down in the Everglades.

50
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,366
Don't stop.

51
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,829
There's coffee.

52
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,087
Your mother took Tommy
to Child's for an ice cream.

53
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,384
He's a good boy.

54
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,521
It's nice, the skin tones.

55
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,441
Thank you.

56
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,903
I also like the other one...

57
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,988
The lady with the flowers.

58
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,408
I didn't even think you noticed.

59
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,834
Over in Europe,

60
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,798
the war... Art, painting, poetry...

61
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,053
Two weeks in the trench and you forget

62
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:13,849
that there's anything beautiful
in the civilized world.

63
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,135
That's it.

64
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,390
A little red.

65
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,228
That's better.

66
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,048
Anything on the ratification?

67
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,218
It's all in the hands of Tennessee.

68
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:16,180
One more state,
then women will have the right to vote.

69
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,058
You look doubtful.

70
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,019
I don't want you to be disappointed.

71
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,358
The South, they're not exactly known
for their forward thinking down there.

72
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,908
- Your driver Mr. Kessler is here.
- Five minutes.

73
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,167
- I don't mean to be cruel, but...
- He's a war hero, Margaret.

74
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,002
He frightens the children.

75
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,339
He's here for your protection,
for their protection.

76
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,343
These men who are after you,

77
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,388
- has anything been done?
- It's being handled.

78
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,015
- By the sheriff?
- And his deputies.

79
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,604
Perhaps the children and I
should go away for a while.

80
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,939
That won't be necessary.

81
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,444
Besides, I'd miss you too much.

82
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,742
Is this what it means to be in charge?
People shooting at you?

83
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,038
Success breeds enemies,

84
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,041
which you'll discover soon enough,
after women win the vote.

85
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,675
Stock prices over the ticker,

86
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,302
racing results by wire.

87
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,054
Soon radio, I'm told,
will transmit news stories

88
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,973
within minutes of their occurrence.

89
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,434
It's the age of information,

90
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:47,646
and a businessman lives,
and sometimes dies, on its value.

91
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,444
Do you know why I'm a successful gambler,
Mr. Doyle?

92
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,322
'Cause you're lucky?

93
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,492
He's Lucky. I create my luck.

94
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,498
I'm a successful gambler
because I never bet on an event

95
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,959
whose outcome I'm not sure of in advance.

96
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,461
Like the World Series.

97
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,673
You put the fix in.

98
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,386
I employ research, fact finding...

99
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:23,223
- "Due diligence" the lawyers call it.
- Which brings me to Nucky Thompson,

100
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,353
the man you said you know everything about.

101
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,229
How was I supposed to know
his chauffeur carries a gun?

102
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,608
Have you been listening
to a single word I've said?

103
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,446
Sheer and utter incompetence!

104
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,324
A woman is shot,

105
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:44,953
an innocent tourist, no less,
and you've tipped my hand to Thompson.

106
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:49,666
The Boardwalk at night, do it in public...
We figure it sends a message.

107
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:53,170
You sent a message, all right.
That you're idiots.

108
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,384
Devil's food?

109
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,885
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

110
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,056
- I'll kill that prick myself, Mr. Rothstein.
- We'll bring you his head if you want.

111
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:10,062
Your grandstanding is commendable,
but I have to say I'm less than convinced.

112
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,940
We had bad information, like you said.

113
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,527
How can we make it up to you?

114
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,991
Nothing says "I'm sorry" like money.

115
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,585
Two and a half million people
in Chicago alone,

116
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,672
figure half of them are men.

117
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,340
- Half of those...
- Put that in.

118
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,801
...are adult men, and there's my point.

119
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:45,347
With over half a million potential customers
who wanna drink whiskey and fuck,

120
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,224
why ain't we making more money?

121
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,687
Fuck you doing? Are you listening?

122
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,232
- What?
- You listening?

123
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,526
Yeah, the money.

124
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,780
Mr. Torrio, Jake Guzik.

125
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,532
Sure, send him in.

126
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,536
There's the beer baron.

127
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,413
Are you giving the cooze away?

128
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,748
I had to park all the way up Wabash.

129
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,542
A little exercise will kill you?

130
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,420
I get enough exercise carrying your dough.

131
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,508
All this from the brewery?

132
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,219
I go home stinking of beer,
but who's complaining?

133
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,181
When he ran the brothel, he stunk of pussy.

134
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,392
So long as it ain't kugel,
the wife stays off my back.

135
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,394
I wanted to talk to you about expanding,

136
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,980
and not just your waistline neither.

137
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,524
- I was saying...
- Johnny, Turkish.

138
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:42,154
Before you come in, I was saying,
a lot of money being left on the table.

139
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,157
As far as I'm concerned,
the whole North Side is wide open.

140
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,869
There's entire 10-block stretches

141
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,413
without a single cathouse
or a place to get a drink.

142
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,128
The fuck is this?

143
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,464
It's a load from the joke shop.

144
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,090
What are you, 12 years old?

145
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,426
It's a joke. I'm sorry.

146
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,720
You are sorry. You're a sorry fucking moron.

147
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,180
I thought you'd have a laugh.

148
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,476
I'm in the middle of a fucking meeting!

149
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,029
We'll talk Saturday, your kid's...
What do you call it?

150
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,990
- Bar mitzvah.
- Yeah.

151
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,910
This ain't no fucking grade school.

152
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,956
He's grotesque, James.

153
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,833
And believe me,
I've seen my share of freak shows.

154
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,462
Apparently, it's a big improvement
over how he looked before the surgery.

155
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,131
Try explaining that to a 4-year-old.

156
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,969
From now on, when he's in the house,
just tell him to keep the mask on.

157
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,888
Mickey Doyle.

158
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,599
- What about him?
- To see you.

159
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,519
- Here?
- Shall I frisk him?

160
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,146
You're Tom Mix all of a sudden?

161
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,565
You do it.

162
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,713
Nucky, hey, how you been?

163
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,215
- What do you want, Mickey?
- Come on, Nuck.

164
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,509
I come to youse hat in hand.

165
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,558
I came to apologize, is all.
I got rattled when you took my operation.

166
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,185
So you pick yourself up by the bootstraps.

167
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,607
Yeah, but I told you I have partners.

168
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,691
So?

169
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,693
The D'Alessio brothers.

170
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,987
From Philly?

171
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,155
Mmm-hmm.

172
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,198
- They're your partners?
- Mmm-hmm.

173
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,164
I should throw you out that fucking window.

174
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,333
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what they was planning.

175
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,710
Not half as sorry as you're gonna be.

176
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:06,381
I can help. That's why I come here.
I'll tell youse everything I know.

177
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,597
Get him a drink.

178
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,141
I should piss in it.

179
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,001
It started months back, after I got out of jail.

180
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,463
They wanted their dough, which I didn't have,

181
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,674
so they got the idea
to put Chalky out of business.

182
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,467
- The lynching, that was them?
- Mmm-hmm.

183
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,888
They robbed your ward boss, too.
The fat one. Plus the casino.

184
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,599
They shot my brother, Mickey,
took a shot at me.

185
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,017
I know it.

186
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:04,106
They're gonna shoot me, Nuck.
I know that, too.

187
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,900
- How?
- They're always jabbering in Italian,

188
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,152
laughing at me behind my back,

189
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,696
right to my face.

190
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,281
And Luciano. How does he figure in?

191
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,243
- Your mother didn't tell you?
- Watch your step, Mickey.

192
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,745
He's got this kid,
some sheeny named Lansky.

193
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:22,499
He approached Chalky, made him an offer,
but it was really just a whatsit.

194
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,043
- A ruse?
- That's the ticket.

195
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,670
To find out how many bottles he's moving.

196
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,089
- Why does he wanna know that?
- Why do you think?

197
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,966
For information.

198
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,719
This is all on orders from Rothstein.

199
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,928
He wants to muscle in,

200
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,973
take over the liquor business in Atlantic City.

201
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,766
Ruining baseball isn't enough?

202
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,105
- Get Chalky on the phone.
- Yeah.

203
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,482
For what?

204
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,115
Eddie's on the line.

205
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,159
God damn it. Eddie!

206
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,245
Hang up the goddamn phone.

207
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,706
That was Trenton. It just came over the wire.

208
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,834
The women have received
the permission to vote.

209
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,677
"'I built that palace,
and the Emerald City, too,

210
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,929
"remarked the Wizard in a thoughtful tone.

211
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,765
"'And I'd like to see them again,

212
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,642
"'for I was very happy
among the Munchkins and Winkies

213
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,519
"'and Quadlings and Gillikins."

214
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,688
"'Who are they?" asked the boy.

215
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,066
"'The four nations that inhabit
the Land of Oz" was the reply.

216
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,535
Sorry.

217
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,374
Mr. Harrow.

218
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,710
Hmm?

219
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,007
We're reading The Wizard of Oz,
by Frank Baum.

220
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,425
Yes.

221
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,845
Please join us if you'd like.

222
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,266
Thank you.

223
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:14,820
"'I wonder if they would treat me nicely
if I went there again? '

224
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,447
"'Of course they would" declared Dorothy.

225
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,658
"'They are still proud of their former Wizard,

226
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,952
"'and often speak of you kindly.

227
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,913
"'Do you happen to know
whatever became of the Tin Woodsman

228
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,123
"'and the Scarecrow? ' He enquired.

229
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,125
"'They live in Oz yet" said the girl,

230
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,586
"'and are very important people."'

231
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,718
The Tin Woodsman.

232
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,097
That's me.

233
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,062
I think I need some oil.

234
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,275
Mama, it's really him?

235
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,320
Why, yes, dear, directly from Oz.

236
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,452
And who better to have in our house
than the mighty Tin Woodsman?

237
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,231
I won't insult you
by asking if you want any,

238
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,817
but I hope you don't mind if I have a taste.

239
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,362
Good news just isn't the same without it.

240
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,697
Annabelle offered me some earlier.

241
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,408
Does that mean I shouldn't try again?

242
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,579
Well, it is a special occasion.

243
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,831
That it is.

244
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,001
Thank you.

245
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,093
To the women's vote.

246
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,303
You've caught up with Ireland at last.

247
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,722
It's your country, too, you know.

248
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,691
You're aware, of course,
of all the Republican Party has done

249
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,109
for social progress.

250
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,486
Emancipation, Prohibition.

251
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,321
We backed the women's vote early.

252
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,658
Because you saw an opportunity.

253
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,994
A simple "thank you" would be fine.

254
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,705
Thank you.

255
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,588
Sunday, at the League of
Women Voters luncheon,

256
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,717
Mayor Bacharach will be announcing
that he won't be seeking reelection.

257
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,094
I'd like you to tell the ladies

258
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,014
why Edward Bader should be his replacement.

259
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,099
And why should he be?

260
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,144
Because he's the right man for the job.

261
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,271
The owner of a construction business?

262
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,608
Who's going to help me build great things
for the people of this city.

263
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,904
But how does that qualify him to be mayor?

264
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,783
Andrew Johnson was a tailor
and he became president.

265
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,994
Wasn't he impeached?

266
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,414
That's completely beside the point.

267
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,212
What am I meant to say?

268
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:05,091
That it's time for a change,
that it's a new Republican Party.

269
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,761
The cronyism, the incompetence,

270
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,971
the violence in our streets.

271
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,599
All that's a thing of the past.

272
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,059
Is it?

273
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,478
What do you mean?

274
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,315
If Bader is elected,
what happens to the county treasurer?

275
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,484
Me? I'm not going anywhere.

276
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,236
You'll control the new mayor
just like the old one?

277
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,031
I don't control anyone, Margaret.

278
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,575
I'm more of an overseer.

279
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,745
For this city to work,
for business to be done over the long haul,

280
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,831
there needs to be cooperation,
continuity of leadership.

281
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,418
As county treasurer, I provide that continuity.

282
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:44,005
Fletcher and these other Democrats,
they'd be starting from scratch.

283
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:49,135
You're asking me to lie
about Bader's qualifications.

284
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,183
I'm asking you to be realistic.

285
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,270
This isn't some fantasy world,
like in one of those children's books.

286
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,980
It's a real place with real people.

287
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,317
And sometimes, to make it run properly,

288
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,653
we need to tell those people
what they want to hear.

289
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:13,993
This is important, Margaret,
not just for the Republican Party.

290
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,579
It's important for you, too.

291
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,811
Look at this. Look, Tommy, look.

292
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,020
This is where we got you.

293
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,565
They cooked you up
in one of those incubators,

294
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,401
wrapped you up in a diaper,
and then we took you home.

295
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,904
- You're fooling me!
- Fooling you, huh?

296
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,368
Hey, where you going?

297
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,412
Tommy, Tommy, come here.

298
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,706
Come here.

299
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,208
You want some taffy?

300
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,544
That's Mommy's kissing friend.

301
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,921
What'd you say?

302
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,424
That's Mommy's kissing friend.

303
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,595
"Kissing friend"?

304
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,605
Son of a bitch!

305
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,440
Jimmy, what's wrong?

306
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:27,901
Ask your son!

307
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:33,448
Wendell, I'm gonna need you to be very still,
like a statue in a museum.

308
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,959
Wendell!

309
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,174
You wanna have your mettle tested?

310
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,844
Oh, my God! Get back!

311
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,102
Jimmy.

312
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,355
Don't fucking move.

313
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,774
Jimmy!

314
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,068
Jimmy, why are you doing this?

315
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,403
Jimmy, stop.

316
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,572
- Jimmy!
- Hey, buddy!

317
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:15,657
Hey, pal.

318
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,785
Jimmy, stop it, please!

319
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,328
Daddy!

320
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:25,208
This man had relations with my wife...

321
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,627
- That's not true.
- ...when I was away in the war.

322
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,631
- No, Jimmy. Please, stop it.
- Daddy, Daddy.

323
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,925
Daddy!

324
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,805
Coming.

325
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:46,854
Ma'am.

326
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,148
Agent Van Alden.

327
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,984
May I come in?

328
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,821
Of course, yes. Please.

329
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,208
This is Mr. Harrow.

330
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,670
I'm a federal agent.

331
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,507
I need to speak privately with Mrs. Schroeder.

332
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,802
I'll be out back with the children.

333
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,321
Mrs. Schroeder, I'm going
to show you a photograph.

334
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:40,074
I'd like to know if you recognize this girl.

335
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,914
Is this meant to be a joke?

336
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,500
I find nothing funny about it.

337
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,921
That's me,

338
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:55,798
taken at Ellis Island.

339
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,634
After your long journey from Kerry.

340
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,763
That's right.

341
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,432
When I look at this girl, I see hope,

342
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:09,604
yearning, a promise for a new life,

343
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,565
the promise of America.

344
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,861
What happened to that girl, Mrs. Schroeder?

345
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,281
Am I to be deported?

346
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,241
I'm a citizen of this country now.

347
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:26,788
Mrs. Schroeder,
you are consorting with a murderer,

348
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,707
the man who killed the father of your children.

349
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,126
- That's not true.
- It is true.

350
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,462
He's a panderer and a criminal.

351
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,798
Mr. Thompson is one of the most...

352
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,717
Your life doesn't have to be like this.

353
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,346
And I know you don't want it to be.

354
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:50,061
- You don't know me at all.
- I can see into your soul, Margaret,

355
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,647
at night, when I look at this picture.

356
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,571
- Give me that photograph.
- Listen to me.

357
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,449
How dare you lecture me?

358
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,830
You gained entrance to my home
on the pretense of official business,

359
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:13,000
when your true intentions are
obviously something quite different.

360
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,254
Is this the life you want?

361
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,756
I can offer you salvation.

362
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,676
I want you to leave now.

363
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,725
I came here to save you.

364
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,812
Not from prosecution,
but from the fires of hell

365
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:36,941
that will surely await you
should you fail to repent.

366
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,636
You need to say this word for word.

367
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,057
Find us some seats.

368
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,352
Hiya. Who's this handsome man?

369
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,320
- Hello.
- Hey.

370
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:26,157
You must wear a hat in the synagogue.
It's a sign of respect.

371
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,661
- To wear it is a sign of respect?
- Yes.

372
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,498
Wear a hat in church, they box your ears in.

373
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:39,921
In the Jewish religion, men wear a yarmulke
to remind us that God is above us.

374
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,885
- You're a friend of the bar mitzvah?
- Jake?

375
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,304
Mr. Guzik's son.

376
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,641
Yeah, I'm an associate of Jake's.

377
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,149
Hey. So this party,

378
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,026
what is it exactly?

379
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:07,198
When a Jewish boy reaches 13,
he becomes a son of the commandment,

380
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:11,327
and this celebration
affirms his obligations as a man.

381
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,537
What, at 13?

382
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:16,249
Do you not feel that's old enough
to be held accountable for your actions?

383
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,504
I know the state does.
That's why they got reform school.

384
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,635
All of us who are worth anything
spend our manhood

385
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,055
unlearning the follies of our youth.

386
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,767
Gentlemen, we're about to begin.

387
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,478
- We'll finish this later.
- Good, okay.

388
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,944
You should wear a yarmulke.

389
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,320
What's wrong with this?

390
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:50,616
You're a man, yet you wear the cap of a boy.

391
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,096
Amen.

392
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,167
Amen.

393
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,505
Mazel tov!

394
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,600
Meyer Lansky,
that's the kid who came to see you.

395
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,977
He told me his name was Michael Lewis.

396
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,648
So he doesn't have to change
the monogram on his shirts.

397
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:07,068
He's in cahoots with Arnold Rothstein
and this family of dagos out of Philly.

398
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,736
Charlie Luciano, too.

399
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,906
- Those the boys who shot you?
- Among other things.

400
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,742
They shot at him. They were not successful.

401
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,286
Why are you still here?

402
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,206
If there will be nothing else...

403
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,754
Sorry I'm late.

404
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,051
What'd you do to your hand?

405
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,680
I slammed it in the icebox.

406
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,976
I want you to meet with Lansky.
Mickey here will arrange it.

407
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,478
Tell him you accept his offer.

408
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,606
- What offer?
- Whatever offer he makes.

409
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,191
Tell him you're unhappy,

410
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,318
that Nucky's not treating you right.

411
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:50,820
That shouldn't be too hard to believe.

412
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,905
You're lucky to be alive, you fucking Polack.

413
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,033
Promise them as much liquor as they want.

414
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,786
And tell them they'll need
all their men to haul the load.

415
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:02,081
The idea is to get as many of them
in the same place as we can.

416
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,626
Remembering, of course,
it was me who set it up.

417
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,675
So,

418
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,970
when all is said and done,

419
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,808
what you fixing to do about Mr. Rothstein?

420
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,563
I'm going to make him
the richest corpse in New York.

421
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:32,069
And go though I must,
I assure you I do so with a heavy heart.

422
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:37,074
But behind my sadness,
there is also great pride

423
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,661
in what we have achieved as a community.

424
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:45,207
And a great optimism...

425
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,794
It's perfectly natural to be nervous.
Just remember to breathe.

426
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,963
It's not nerves exactly.

427
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,381
Did you eat a good breakfast?

428
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,218
- I've got no appetite.
- You'll be fine.

429
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,805
The first time I had to make
one of these speeches, I was a wreck.

430
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,391
After a while, you can get up there
and sell snake oil.

431
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,977
And my love for public service
shall never cease.

432
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,776
Ladies,

433
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,694
it is now my great pleasure

434
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,363
to introduce Mrs. Margaret Schroeder.

435
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,266
Thank you, Mayor Bacharach.

436
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,227
And thank you, ladies.

437
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,231
You will surely be missed.

438
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,367
When I was first asked to speak to you today,

439
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:06,664
I confess I was at once flattered and terrified.

440
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,042
Surely, an immigrant to this great country,

441
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,170
a former parlor maid,
could have little to contribute

442
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,089
to political discourse.

443
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,844
But when I heard I was to speak
in support of Edward Bader for mayor,

444
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:24,890
I put my trepidations aside
and decided to speak to you from the heart.

445
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,183
I know. Thank you.

446
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,978
I first met Mr. Bader socially

447
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:32,982
in his capacity as head
of the city's largest construction firm.

448
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,610
Mr. Bader is quite literally a builder,

449
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,821
a man of great vision.

450
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:44,034
Where other men see an empty lot,
he sees a hospital.

451
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:49,248
Where other men see an overgrown field,
he sees a school for our children.

452
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,458
And most importantly, perhaps,

453
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:55,379
where other men see
shop girls and chambermaids,

454
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,298
Edward Bader sees voters.

455
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:11,186
Ladies, our newly gained right
also comes with great responsibility.

456
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,815
A duty to use our power wisely,

457
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,610
to elect men to office,

458
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:21,864
worthy men, who will put the interest
of our citizens first.

459
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,409
With us as a foundation, women voters,

460
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,121
our new mayor can do
great things for Atlantic City.

461
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:34,335
And who better to start with that foundation
than a builder himself?

462
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:41,675
Ladies, I give you our next mayor,
Mr. Edward Bader.

463
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,895
That was wonderful.

464
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,152
Thank you, Mrs. Schroeder,
for that rousing introduction.

465
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:07,785
Ladies, I could not be more pleased
than I am right now to join you here today

466
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:13,624
and welcome you as meaningful partners
in our great democracy.

467
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,716
When I was approached
to be part of this Republican ticket,

468
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:28,138
I was not only humbled,
but excited to continue my work

469
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,350
for the men, the women,
and the children of Atlantic City.

470
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,313
Enjoy yourself, Loretta.

471
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,273
Have some drinks.

472
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,276
Mr. Torrio.

473
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,202
- Where are you going?
- Wherever you tell me.

474
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,959
I'm here to apologize.

475
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:00,713
The joke, the cigarette load, that was stupid.

476
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,881
You can't do that shit no more.

477
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,675
I know.

478
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,513
You know,

479
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:13,350
I brung you out here from Brooklyn
for a reason, kid.

480
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,270
I thought I saw something in you.

481
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,856
A fellow like Guzik.

482
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,734
Three years ago, he's running a cathouse.

483
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,652
Now look at him today.

484
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:25,904
You could learn something from these Jews.

485
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,451
The brewery there,
I hear they're looking for help.

486
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,494
His distribution's out of whack.

487
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,872
The fellow there now
has got it all screwed up.

488
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,375
Maybe I can fix it.

489
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,961
No more monkey business, Al.

490
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,463
Finito.

491
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,049
I hear you, Mr. Torrio.

492
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,052
All's I'm asking for is a chance.

493
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,013
I'm ready to be responsible for my actions.

494
00:39:57,187 --> 00:40:01,899
Twenty-two year I know Nucky Thompson,
back when the Commodore had this town.

495
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:05,569
I ran the dice game here,
in Chicken Bone Beach.

496
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,155
Nucky made the Commodore collection.

497
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,950
Then one day, I seen the Commodore himself.

498
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,954
A parade here for Mr. Booker T. Washington.

499
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,416
"Chalky," he say,

500
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,668
"I got bad news.

501
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,464
"Now on, you got to pay me 7%
of what you been making."

502
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,633
"7%?" I say.

503
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,221
"I been paying Nucky 12 long
for three years now."

504
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,724
- Real prick that guy, Thompson.
- That's putting it kindly, son.

505
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,768
- He was skimming off the top.
- Yes.

506
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,686
Thank you. I get it.

507
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,358
Well, I hope his reputation precedes him,

508
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,819
but Mr. Rothstein doesn't do business
like that.

509
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,987
Chiseling your partners, it's short-sighted.

510
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,116
- We're looking to the future.
- These stills,

511
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,451
this piss water you're bottling?

512
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,412
Don't get me wrong, it's fine for some people,

513
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,665
but we're looking for the real stuff.

514
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,167
Can you part with 500 cases a month?

515
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,295
You know I can,

516
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,713
Mr. Lewis.

517
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,135
No offense.

518
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,720
That was before Mr. Doyle here
told us how unhappy you were.

519
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:17,349
Yeah, now that we know,
you'll be our contact down in Atlantic City.

520
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:21,061
Play your cards right, you can buy a Packard
for every day in the week.

521
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:27,776
- Tomorrow late, we'll send trucks.
- The money, too.

522
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,328
- What about Nucky?
- Fuck him.

523
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,207
By which he means, you're under the wing
of Arnold Rothstein now.

524
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:44,835
New York Life don't offer
protection that good.

525
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,630
One more thing.

526
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,595
How do you know I drive a Packard?

527
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,120
I stopped by the hospital.
They said you'd already left.

528
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,831
He's sleeping. They gave him morphine.

529
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,085
Five broken ribs, his nose, a fractured jaw.

530
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,547
I'm so sorry, Mary.

531
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:33,133
- It's not your fault. It's mine.
- Yours?

532
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:36,053
I should have left him months ago.
I don't love him.

533
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,972
This never would have happened.

534
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,142
It's not that easy.

535
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,209
I just can't bear it anymore.

536
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,003
- Has he hurt you?
- No,

537
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,588
not yet.

538
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,384
But he's not the same person I knew.

539
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:20,180
Come away with me. You and Tommy.

540
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,518
- Where?
- To Paris.

541
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,941
- What about Robert?
- He'll be fine.

542
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:35,779
He'll recover from his injuries
and move on with his life.

543
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,868
- Jimmy will never let me go.
- He'll never know where to find us.

544
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:46,373
Imagine Tommy growing up along the Seine,
speaking French.

545
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:49,042
He'd be nothing like his father.

546
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,170
Or any of them.

547
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:55,048
Isadora Duncan has a school on Rue Danton.

548
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,592
The children wear Grecian tunics.

549
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,761
She inspires them to find their muses

550
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,888
and free their spirits.

551
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,810
There's a ship leaving once a month.

552
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,734
Nous devons aller à Paris.

553
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,236
Say it.

554
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,905
What does it mean?

555
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,743
We must go to Paris.

556
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:34,379
Nous devons aller à Paris.

557
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,386
And so we must.

558
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,986
Thank you, Deputy Halloran.

559
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,031
Could be Sheriff Halloran, come November.

560
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,700
If Eli's not better.

561
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:35,649
The children are asleep
and Mrs. Charlton just left.

562
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,527
No trouble, I take it?

563
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,821
No. They're very obedient.

564
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,331
To guard against intruders.

565
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,584
Mr. Harrow,

566
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,214
I feel I owe you an apology.

567
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:06,680
When you first came here to guard us,
I treated you harshly.

568
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,642
The truth is your affliction frightened me.

569
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,687
Mmm.

570
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:16,481
People find it disconcerting.

571
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,903
It's unfair, and I'm sorry.

572
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:27,117
We should judge the person on the inside.

573
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,164
I can't do that myself.

574
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,418
So why should you be able to?

575
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,965
Sometimes I forget what I look like.

576
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,845
Then I pass a mirror and I remember.

577
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,100
I stare sometimes at my face

578
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,812
and I can't recall

579
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,857
who I was before.

580
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,315
What'll you have?

581
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,988
Whiskey.

582
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,646
Again.

583
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,735
May I join you?

584
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,029
Sure.

585
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,364
Why not?

586
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,122
Cigarette?

587
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,662
What's your name, handsome?

588
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,082
Nelson.

589
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,879
I could use another drink, Nelson.

590
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,407
This here is Mr. Meyer Lansky.

591
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,119
Say hello to Nucky Thompson.

592
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:42,997
How do you do?

593
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,293
We've already met, actually.

594
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:50,046
You shot at me on the Boardwalk.

595
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,257
You're confusing me with somebody else.

596
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,927
There's another dago walking around
with dog shit on his face?

597
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,563
What happened?
You were supposed to make a deal.

598
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:10,483
Why didn't you tell me
these the motherfuckers that lynched my boy?

599
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,821
- Because I hadn't confirmed it.
- I got all the confirmation I need.

600
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:19,409
There are four more brothers, Chalky,
plus Luciano.

601
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,202
How are we supposed to get to them now?

602
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,871
Mr. Thompson, may I speak with you?

603
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:35,842
I know we've only recently met
and my word doesn't count for much,

604
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,970
but if you could see your way
to letting me go,

605
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,849
I'm quite certain I can work out
an accommodation with Mr. Rothstein.

606
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,435
Mr. Rothstein made his bed.

607
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,395
Now you fellows can die in it.

608
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:49,647
Tough talk
when he ain't in the room, right?

609
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,316
What'd you say?

610
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,234
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you heard me.

611
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,529
What I said was you, Mr. Thompson
and this coon here

612
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,198
could all go fuck each other.

613
00:51:58,699 --> 00:51:59,866
Right.

614
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:08,208
Fucking tough guy.
You gonna shoot me for mouthing off?

615
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:11,211
I wasn't going to,
but you kind of talked me into it.

616
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,894
Anybody else?

617
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,771
Jesus Christ.

618
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,565
What do we do with him?

619
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:37,070
Leave him at the dump
with the rest of the garbage.

620
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,282
My brothers come back,

621
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:46,079
they're gonna string you up higher
than they did that other fucking coon.

622
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,274
You can go now.

623
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,737
And please, tell Mr. Rothstein
what you saw here tonight.

624
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,172
Fuck me.

625
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,341
Fuck me, daddy.

626
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,829
What time is it?

627
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,790
It's late. What are you doing up?

628
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:20,877
I couldn't sleep.

629
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,506
I had business downtown.
I would have called.

630
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:27,717
Business?

631
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,096
Plotting our strategy for the election.

632
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,314
You did very well today

633
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,566
with your speech.

634
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,819
You should get some rest.

635
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:56,454
You had those ladies eating out of your hand.

636
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,054

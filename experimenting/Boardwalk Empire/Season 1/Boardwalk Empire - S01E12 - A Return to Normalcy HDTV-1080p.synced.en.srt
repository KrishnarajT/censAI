1
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:41,297
"To Carthage then I came,

2
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:45,885
"where a cauldron of unholy loves sang all about mine ears."

3
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:51,182
Those are the words of Saint Augustine written 1,500 years ago.

4
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:56,062
His road to the Lord was an arduous one filled with many setbacks.

5
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,564
In Carthage, Carthage by the sea,

6
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:01,692
he found a city devoted to appetite,

7
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,782
to pleasure, to the temptations that keep us from our better selves.

8
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,577
And in that place he did succumb to what was offered.

9
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,832
He did succumb.

10
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:20,086
Gentlemen, Atlantic City

11
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,339
is the grandchild of that vanished metropolis.

12
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,592
Should you aspire to replace me here,

13
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:30,513
and should Supervisor Elliot accept you,

14
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:35,142
you will be bribed, coerced and tempted on a daily basis.

15
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:37,478
Bring on the dancing girls.

16
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:48,781
My partner, Agent Eric Sebso, died in the line of duty of a heart attack.

17
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:55,288
I will not have his memory sullied with infantile humor.

18
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:08,092
The supervisor will review your applications.

19
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:26,819
Nelson, I wish you'd reconsider.

20
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:30,865
There's nothing here for me, sir.

21
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:40,082
- Did you see this?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,963
Buy them drinks, promise them jobs.

23
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,090
Do whatever you need to do to get your people to vote.

24
00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:51,427
And once they do, send them over to my ward and have them vote again.

25
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:53,846
I still say replacing Eli was a mistake.

26
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:56,682
What "still"? You never said a word about it.

27
00:03:57,434 --> 00:04:01,479
I want a big turnout Tuesday, men and women alike.

28
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:03,606
Hell, Nuck, you'll even get spooks.

29
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,566
- What the fuck you just say?
- What?

30
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:09,445
I got my clerk combing the obituaries. He's writing down names.

31
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:12,907
Yet another Atlantic City politician elected by dead people.

32
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:14,951
It's Halloween, Ed. Get in the spirit.

33
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:17,161
Talk about your absentee ballots.

34
00:04:19,373 --> 00:04:22,875
I hope you're half as amusing during your concession speech.

35
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,433
We need to talk.

36
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:44,021
Hey, come on.

37
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:52,530
- Let's go for a walk, guys.
- Let's go blow the stink off ourselves.

38
00:04:54,116 --> 00:04:55,950
I've been approached by the other side.

39
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:58,160
Really?

40
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:00,871
Fletcher and them other Democrats,

41
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:03,499
they paint a nice, pretty picture how it's gonna be

42
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,627
if I throw my weight behind them come election day.

43
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:09,255
And savvy businessman Chalky White believes them.

44
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:12,925
Savvy businessman Chalky White tell 'em he believe 'em,

45
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:15,511
then he pocket their money.

46
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:19,724
I take it that means you're sticking with me?

47
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:22,893
Some recognition for my loyalty would be nice.

48
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,153
You realize you put the bite on me every election?

49
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:35,614
Except this time you could actually lose.

50
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,743
What'd you have in mind?

51
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,119
Oh.

52
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:43,581
Ten grand, a new car.

53
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:48,794
And an invitation to that victory party down at Babette's.

54
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,301
That last part's a tall order, Chalky.

55
00:05:56,344 --> 00:06:00,431
So is delivering 100% of that colored vote.

56
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:08,314
"Upon that night, when fairies light beneath the moon's pale beams,

57
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:13,527
"there, up the cove, they stray and rove and haunt the Halloween."

58
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:15,654
Boo!

59
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,657
More, Mama.

60
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:22,078
That's all for now. I need to finish the cake.

61
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:25,790
You go and wash your hands, please. And you help your sister.

62
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:28,084
The poem, was that Frost?

63
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,335
Robert Burns.

64
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:32,379
My nana would read it each year on All Hallows Eve.

65
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:35,007
Will they recite it tonight in the churchyard?

66
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,011
That's more of a religious service to pray for the souls of the dead.

67
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:42,598
You Catholics certainly have a flair for the dramatic.

68
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:46,227
That we do.

69
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:49,480
Warren loves poetry.

70
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:57,613
Have you thought about where you'll go after Tuesday?

71
00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:01,117
I hate to put you out, but I'm sure Warren will send for us

72
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,035
as soon as he wins the election.

73
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm considering Margate.

74
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:09,959
I could get work in one of the shops.

75
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:14,505
Or perhaps I'll be rich. We'll see what the brack says.

76
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:18,092
The cake. It's called Barmbrack.

77
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,594
The Irish eat it on Halloween.

78
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:24,431
You bake a sixpence, a ring and a small piece of rag inside.

79
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,017
If you get the money, you'll be rich.

80
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:29,979
The ring, of course, means you'll be married.

81
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:34,066
And if you get the rag, well, you'll be destitute.

82
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:37,862
President Warren Harding.

83
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:44,160
You'll come visit, of course, to the White House.

84
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:51,000
And with the arsenic being introduced slowly through food,

85
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:53,335
the victim is often unaware of being poisoned at all.

86
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,921
He'd been complaining about his stomach since Christmas.

87
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,465
It would have to have been going on for some time.

88
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,427
There were toxic levels in his stew, in his tea biscuits.

89
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:04,513
Even his toothpaste was tainted.

90
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:06,307
How do you explain this, Mrs. Pratt?

91
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:11,604
Must have fell in there somehow on accident.

92
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,856
Yet your food was uncontaminated.

93
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,275
She killed Jerry, for God's sake.

94
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,986
I ate one of those cookies, you know.

95
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:22,656
- Who's Jerry?
- His dog.

96
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:24,533
He used to feed him his leftovers.

97
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:26,869
Treat that dog better than me.

98
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,457
Best goddamned friend I had, I can tell you that much.

99
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,918
You goddamn ignorant bitch.

100
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:35,711
After all I did for you.

101
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:37,922
- Calm down, dear.
- The hell I will.

102
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:39,465
She's a fucking murderer!

103
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:45,221
Why did you do this?

104
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:47,473
Poison him?

105
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:51,936
'Cause

106
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,981
if I used a shotgun,

107
00:08:57,317 --> 00:09:01,612
I'd have had to clean the mess up myself.

108
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,450
I had all I could take of his abuse.

109
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:11,580
Are you gonna arrest her or not, Sheriff?

110
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:13,999
No.

111
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:15,668
He's not.

112
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:17,419
What?

113
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:19,255
Come with me.

114
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:34,186
I certainly understand why you'd want to, but you can't go around poisoning people.

115
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:38,691
- What the hell's going on?
- Just let him handle it, dear.

116
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:45,030
Take this and go far away.

117
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:47,574
Change your name and don't come back.

118
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:50,286
God bless you, sir.

119
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:52,705
- Bless you.
- Simmer yourself down.

120
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:55,040
And you be careful.

121
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,293
It's not worth giving yourself a fit.

122
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:58,877
You take this.

123
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:09,013
- What the hell are you doing, Nucky?
- Relax.

124
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:11,640
She tried to kill me, God damn it.

125
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:23,944
I've booked passage for myself and Carolyn.

126
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,991
Should I be indicted personally, and my attorney assures me that's imminent,

127
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,743
he'll let you know how to get in touch.

128
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:34,163
- Scotland in November?
- I hear the golfing is terrific.

129
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:36,332
- In June maybe.
- Trick or treat!

130
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,668
I'll tour the distilleries, take up the bagpipes perhaps.

131
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,795
There are any number of ways to occupy myself

132
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,798
until this baseball business goes away.

133
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:48,010
If you're indicted, it don't sound like it will.

134
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,929
Ain't there anybody in Chicago whose palm you can grease?

135
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:53,307
It's the World Series, Charlie.

136
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:57,353
- I'm a pariah, haven't you heard?
- So use a buffer.

137
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,355
There's Johnny Torrio.

138
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:02,566
He's new out there, doesn't have the political connections.

139
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,777
Nucky Thompson does.

140
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:06,195
And Torrio can connect you to him.

141
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,365
Thompson's not exactly a pal these days, is he?

142
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,618
This war we're in,

143
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:17,831
Charlie and I were talking, there's no percentage in it.

144
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:19,792
I mean, I know I brung them in,

145
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:22,127
but these greaseballs, these D'Alessio brothers...

146
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,629
Not your best suggestion.

147
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:26,423
You're a businessman, right?

148
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:28,050
Maybe you cut your losses.

149
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:30,469
I didn't realize I was paying you boys for advice.

150
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:32,638
The advice is free.

151
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:36,225
You pay us 'cause we'll get our hands dirty.

152
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,375
Hey.

153
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,586
What are you supposed to be? Huh?

154
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:13,053
Hey, Tommy, I asked you a question.

155
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:14,805
- Pirate.
- Pirate?

156
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,103
Hey, why don't you go put your shoes on and get ready for that party?

157
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:36,660
You gonna be home for dinner tonight?

158
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:43,584
- How long are you gonna keep on doing this?
- Doing what?

159
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:49,298
The silences, the cold shoulder, the distrustful looks.

160
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:52,718
If I was a different sort of man, it would be worse than looks.

161
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:55,429
For God's sake, Jimmy, do you want us to leave?

162
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:57,514
What do you mean "us"?

163
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,559
He's my son, too, Angela.

164
00:13:02,604 --> 00:13:05,397
- And what's wrong with him?
- Nothing's wrong with him.

165
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,691
He's disrespectful.

166
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:09,651
He's terrified of you.

167
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:14,740
We both are.

168
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,659
What are you talking about?

169
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,747
You did it again last night.

170
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:26,335
You were screaming in your sleep.

171
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:31,673
- What?
- You grabbed me.

172
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:34,051
You were shaking me,

173
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:36,970
yelling something in German.

174
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:42,100
Your eyes were open, but you weren't there, Jimmy.

175
00:13:45,146 --> 00:13:47,606
I'm afraid you're gonna hurt us.

176
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:56,198
I want to protect you and Tommy.

177
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,166
Sit down.

178
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:16,635
I didn't write to you when I was away in France

179
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:21,098
because I didn't think I was coming back.

180
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:26,728
There are things inside me that I brought home from the war.

181
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:32,651
But there were nights over there in the trenches, I'd be asleep,

182
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:37,281
dream that I could feel you next to me,

183
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,826
that I could touch your hair against my face.

184
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,872
You and Tommy, you're...

185
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:51,920
We both did things

186
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,881
when we were apart

187
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:57,801
for whatever reason.

188
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,557
Were you in love with her?

189
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:10,564
I was lonely, Jimmy.

190
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:15,777
I wanna start fresh.

191
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,490
I wanna go back to where we were.

192
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:26,788
Can you do that?

193
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,417
I think so.

194
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,170
Can you?

195
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:38,383
I'll try.

196
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:05,410
And on this Eve of All Hallows, we honor the saints

197
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,830
and now pray for the souls of the dead.

198
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,668
Oh, Lord, hear my prayer,

199
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:15,545
listen to my cry for mercy,

200
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,632
and in your faithfulness and righteousness

201
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,592
come to my relief.

202
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:24,137
Do not bring your servant unto judgment,

203
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:29,267
for no one living is righteous before you.

204
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,438
Do you pray much yourself?

205
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:37,234
For the children, mostly, for their health,

206
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:40,737
and the ones I lost, of course.

207
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:43,865
- And I pray for forgiveness.
- For what?

208
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,325
My own sins.

209
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:50,122
There's such a peacefulness here, a special kind of quiet.

210
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:53,583
It's like walking through a wood on a crisp autumn...

211
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:57,629
Oh.

212
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,516
So you have that in common.

213
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:15,814
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

214
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:20,694
Mr. Thompson in Chicago, he told me he had a son who died.

215
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:28,535
It's not suspicion. It's prudence.

216
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:31,246
Come on, Nuck, how long we know each other?

217
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,582
I'd like to know what I'll be walking into, John.

218
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,833
A business meeting.

219
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:37,419
For which I'm asking you to keep an open mind.

220
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:40,213
I already bought the Brooklyn Bridge, if that's what you're selling.

221
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:42,758
Noon tomorrow. We'll pick a spot out by you.

222
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:44,217
Ow, God damn it.

223
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:46,470
The train. How you think?

224
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:49,181
Go see who that is.

225
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:50,390
What?

226
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:52,559
I'm on the overnight train.

227
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:54,936
The fuck is going on over there?

228
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:57,647
Nothing. I'm late for a party.

229
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:59,775
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

230
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,963
Yes?

231
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,883
Someone wishes to see you.

232
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:39,564
Leave it on. It suits you.

233
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:43,026
A dapper villain in a Sunday serial.

234
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:45,111
And you?

235
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:47,781
What's your get-up tonight?

236
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:50,075
The devoted, pleading wife,

237
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:53,453
the temperance firebrand, the crusading suffragette?

238
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:56,915
You left out "kept woman."

239
00:18:57,834 --> 00:19:00,544
But there wasn't any keeping you, was there?

240
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:03,588
When you met me, I was pregnant.

241
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:07,467
And then I lost the baby.

242
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:11,930
You lost a child,

243
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:14,599
a son.

244
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:16,977
He was six days old,

245
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:18,937
and your wife a month later.

246
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:22,732
It's a bit late for this game, wouldn't you say?

247
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:25,151
- What game?
- I tell you my sorrows,

248
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:28,864
you pretend to be sympathetic, and we wind up in bed.

249
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:31,533
I can assure you that won't happen.

250
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:37,873
Why are you here?

251
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,626
To find out who Enoch Thompson is.

252
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:52,304
Seven years ago, almost eight,

253
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:55,807
I'd just become treasurer.

254
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,895
I was new to the job, very busy.

255
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:03,440
My wife had just given birth.

256
00:20:05,151 --> 00:20:07,569
We named him Enoch after me.

257
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,156
She wanted that.

258
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:20,665
He was tiny, frail.

259
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,085
I was terrified to hold him.

260
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:27,672
A week passed.

261
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:33,970
I had my hands full with some county business or another, an audit.

262
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:37,474
I was busy, very busy.

263
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:42,520
I came home one night.

264
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:44,731
It was late.

265
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:49,736
She was in the nursery, rocking him in her arms.

266
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:52,405
I crossed to them.

267
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,162
She looked so calm, so contented.

268
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:03,041
It gave me the courage to finally wanna hold him.

269
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:07,379
I pulled back the blanket,

270
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:24,229
and I looked at his face.

271
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:27,941
And I could tell right away

272
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,778
he'd been dead for days.

273
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:36,408
She'd been caring for him nearly a week.

274
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:42,330
Bathing him, changing his diapers, his bedclothes.

275
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:51,256
I took him from her and cradled him in my arms.

276
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:56,469
That was the only time I ever held him.

277
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,058
We buried him in the churchyard,

278
00:22:02,143 --> 00:22:04,602
but she couldn't accept it.

279
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:08,356
She'd completely broken with reality.

280
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:11,276
Melancholia.

281
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:16,031
I saw it.

282
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:18,450
I knew it.

283
00:22:18,743 --> 00:22:22,662
But the doctor said time would heal her.

284
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:27,792
And I was very, very busy.

285
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:36,051
A few weeks later,

286
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:39,304
she slashed her wrists with my razor.

287
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:56,112
The times with you and the children in the house,

288
00:22:58,157 --> 00:23:01,117
eating breakfast, just that,

289
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:05,080
I've never been happier

290
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,334
or more terrified in my life.

291
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:17,425
And now you know more about me than any other person on earth.

292
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:23,181
And you thought I needed saving.

293
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:25,433
Didn't you?

294
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:30,188
Not the way you chose.

295
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,864
You'll leave Atlantic City?

296
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:45,912
- Is that your demand?
- It's just a question.

297
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,127
I think it might be for the best.

298
00:23:57,716 --> 00:23:59,843
- Let me...
- No.

299
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:02,095
Thank you.

300
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:10,770
There's a kindness in you.

301
00:24:12,106 --> 00:24:13,439
I know it.

302
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:19,028
How can you do what you do?

303
00:24:20,614 --> 00:24:25,034
We all have to decide for ourselves how much sin we can live with.

304
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:31,374
Mr. Thompson.

305
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:34,419
Mrs. Schroeder.

306
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:38,506
I'm pleased to have finally made your acquaintance.

307
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:05,783
- Would you care for a biscuit?
- The molasses hurts my filling.

308
00:25:11,874 --> 00:25:16,085
I was offered a permanent assignment in Atlantic City.

309
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:20,423
I discovered a large still near where Sebso expired.

310
00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:24,469
We had originally gone to the area looking for it.

311
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,097
- Your supervisor must have been pleased.
- He was.

312
00:25:28,432 --> 00:25:32,852
I was offered a raise in pay as well as two additional agents under my command.

313
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:35,188
That's wonderful.

314
00:25:35,397 --> 00:25:37,065
I turned him down.

315
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:43,196
My Uncle Byron, I never told you this,

316
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,824
but a year ago last Easter, he made me a proposition,

317
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,328
full partner in his feed business.

318
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,164
In Schenectady.

319
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:57,001
You enjoyed our visit there, the winter with the snowshoes.

320
00:25:59,797 --> 00:26:04,259
Of course I'd have to buy in, but it's a going concern.

321
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:14,894
You're being awfully quiet.

322
00:26:16,522 --> 00:26:19,607
I like being the wife of a federal agent.

323
00:26:20,526 --> 00:26:23,027
Is that what's important, your vanity?

324
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:25,947
What your friends think down at the greengrocer's?

325
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:28,491
- Of course not.
- I'm unhappy, Rose.

326
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,789
Unfulfilled. Increasingly so these last few months.

327
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:41,629
And now with Agent Sebso's death...

328
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:50,096
You're doing God's work there, Nelson.

329
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:59,272
Then, if God wants me to stay in Atlantic City, let him give me a sign.

330
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:08,549
- What the hell is this?
- Thanks for coming.

331
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:10,635
- How're you doing, kid?
- Mr. Torrio.

332
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:12,345
I don't like being sandbagged.

333
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,639
Come on. Costs nothing to listen.

334
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:20,019
Then start talking.

335
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:25,483
The last time we was all together, there was another man as well.

336
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:28,069
- Big Jim Colosimo.
- May he rest in peace.

337
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:31,155
He was a good man, Jim, don't get me wrong. But he didn't look ahead.

338
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:34,700
He didn't look from behind neither, from what Frankie Yale told me.

339
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:36,202
Grow up, huh?

340
00:28:36,954 --> 00:28:38,246
With the stupid jokes.

341
00:28:38,831 --> 00:28:43,751
My point is, to survive in a business like ours, you gotta look to the future.

342
00:28:44,711 --> 00:28:47,672
And to do that, sometimes you gotta let go of the past.

343
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,258
It was Arnold who reached out, asked that we meet.

344
00:28:50,342 --> 00:28:52,093
The son of a bitch tried to have me killed.

345
00:28:52,302 --> 00:28:55,304
I'm interested, Mr. Thompson, in putting an end to our hostilities.

346
00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:58,766
I would think you would be, considering the way things are going.

347
00:28:58,851 --> 00:29:00,977
We could wage war for years.

348
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:04,105
It benefits no one.

349
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:07,108
And the fact is I have enough problems already.

350
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:08,401
Yes, I've seen the newspapers.

351
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:11,279
Then you know I'm about to be indicted for fixing the World Series.

352
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:13,406
- So pay someone off.
- There's the rub.

353
00:29:13,824 --> 00:29:17,785
Though I'm quite well known in Chicago, I'm decidedly not well liked there.

354
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:20,204
It sounds to me like you're asking for a favor.

355
00:29:20,372 --> 00:29:22,790
I'm asking to make a deal.

356
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:26,002
I need a man with your political reach to quash the indictment.

357
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:34,010
- That could be arranged.
- What?

358
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:36,554
We're talking.

359
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:42,393
In exchange for what?

360
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:45,146
One million in cash.

361
00:29:50,611 --> 00:29:51,903
A million dollars.

362
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,072
And the location of the remaining D'Alessio brothers.

363
00:29:57,326 --> 00:30:00,786
Or you could take your chances in Chicago with my good friend Hartley Replogle.

364
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:03,498
The State's Attorney.

365
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:05,500
So you've seen the papers, also.

366
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:14,592
This war ends here.

367
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:16,427
Any bad blood,

368
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:21,307
past transgressions of whatever nature, business or personal, are hereby nullified.

369
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:27,522
I'll have the cash delivered to you in the morning.

370
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:29,649
Charlie here has the other information you want.

371
00:30:30,817 --> 00:30:32,610
Good luck, Mr. Thompson.

372
00:30:33,237 --> 00:30:35,363
I do hope we haven't seen the last of each other.

373
00:30:36,406 --> 00:30:38,157
Now, if you'll excuse me,

374
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:41,369
I've got a train to Chicago.

375
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:55,800
Get my brother on the phone,

376
00:30:55,884 --> 00:30:58,302
then call an emergency press conference today at City Hall.

377
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,137
- What time? - 3:00 p.m. Sharp.

378
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:03,724
I want every newspaper in the county there.

379
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:17,154
Gentlemen of the Fourth Estate,

380
00:31:17,823 --> 00:31:22,618
tragic though it is, I need hardly remind you that the passage of the 18th Amendment

381
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:25,913
has given rise to a new breed of criminal.

382
00:31:25,998 --> 00:31:29,917
Vicious thugs emboldened by the promise of an easy dollar.

383
00:31:33,046 --> 00:31:35,965
What the fuck are you doing? Halloween's over.

384
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:43,431
Last January, in the woods

385
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:46,434
only a few miles from where I speak to you today,

386
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:49,937
a horrible massacre occurred.

387
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:52,565
Five men, bootleggers all,

388
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:56,402
were cut down in cold blood by a rival gang.

389
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:03,034
The suspected ringleader of the killers, Hans Schroeder, was found dead days later,

390
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:07,371
his body washed up in a fishing net on one of our piers.

391
00:32:07,873 --> 00:32:11,375
Due to the tireless work of my brother,

392
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:15,713
former Sheriff Eli Thompson, we have since learned

393
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:19,508
that Schroeder's conspirators in this cowardly attack

394
00:32:19,843 --> 00:32:22,803
were a group of killers late of Philadelphia,

395
00:32:22,888 --> 00:32:26,182
well-known to law enforcement as the D'Alessio brothers.

396
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:33,022
I am happy to report they are being sought for questioning as I speak.

397
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:42,448
Motivated by political gain,

398
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:47,078
the Democrats have argued that the incumbent administration

399
00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:51,165
has been rife with corruption, soft on crime.

400
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:55,461
On this election eve, I submit to you this:

401
00:32:55,545 --> 00:32:59,965
While this heinous crime did certainly occur on the Republican watch,

402
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,095
the apprehension of those responsible did as well.

403
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:27,952
Vote for Edward Bader tomorrow and keep our city safe.

404
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:32,373
I thank you all, and God bless America.

405
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:36,168
How about a picture with your brother?

406
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:45,678
No more pictures. Let's go. Come on.

407
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,138
Go, go, go, go.

408
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:01,819
How are you today? Nice to see you.

409
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:04,321
All right, a good day to vote, isn't it? Yes, sir.

410
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:05,406
Hey, how are you?

411
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,866
Hello, how are you?

412
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:09,910
Nice to see you. Congratulations, ladies.

413
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,121
- Good day.
- Thank you.

414
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:13,205
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

415
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:16,125
All right, thanks for coming out. Nice to see you.

416
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:18,586
How are you? Hello there.

417
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,463
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you. Thanks for coming out.

418
00:34:20,547 --> 00:34:21,630
- Hey, Mr. Thompson.
- How are you today?

419
00:34:21,715 --> 00:34:24,091
- Hi, Francis. How's your mother?
- Much better, Nucky.

420
00:34:24,176 --> 00:34:26,010
Hello, Bill. How are you?

421
00:34:26,178 --> 00:34:27,386
Good day, Mr. Thompson.

422
00:34:28,096 --> 00:34:30,014
Hi, Mr. Thompson.

423
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:38,272
How are you? Nice to see you today.

424
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:40,191
Hey, squirt, who you voting for?

425
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:42,902
- Hey, good luck to you, Nucky.
- How are you?

426
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:44,278
- Attaboy, Nuck.
- Hi.

427
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:47,031
- Some turnout, huh?
- Say, Nuck, who you voting for?

428
00:34:47,324 --> 00:34:49,575
Ed Bader and the straight Republican ticket.

429
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:52,203
And I suggest you all do the same.

430
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:21,899
Ange?

431
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:29,907
Hey, buddy.

432
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:34,453
- Where's your mother?
- I don't know.

433
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:42,503
I'm right here. I was in the bedroom.

434
00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:48,425
Your father called. He asked to see you.

435
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:26,547
That uniform looks like it fits you.

436
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:30,593
How much?

437
00:36:31,845 --> 00:36:34,889
Third ward results are in. We're up by over 20%.

438
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:41,979
Easy, kid. What, are you down a quart?

439
00:36:42,063 --> 00:36:45,649
- It's great times here.
- Champagne, here you go.

440
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:50,738
It just came over the wire.

441
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:57,077
The State's Attorney in Chicago announced that Arnold Rothstein will not be indicted.

442
00:36:57,162 --> 00:36:58,495
Anything on the mayor's race?

443
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,332
Well, the polls will be closing shortly.

444
00:37:07,172 --> 00:37:08,964
Almost home, little brother.

445
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:11,425
Just like that, huh?

446
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:15,512
You wave your scepter and everything's all forgiven?

447
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:18,474
Your cut of the Rothstein money isn't enough?

448
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:19,642
Should I send flowers, too?

449
00:37:19,726 --> 00:37:22,436
You fucked me over, brother. You forget?

450
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:24,897
And I told you I'll make it right.

451
00:37:26,816 --> 00:37:30,277
You do this stuff, you say things.

452
00:37:31,738 --> 00:37:33,739
Maybe you're so used to spouting bullshit, you don't realize it,

453
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:35,824
but your words actually do affect people.

454
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:38,285
What's that? Dale Carnegie?

455
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,536
I'm fucking serious, Nucky.

456
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:42,581
There are consequences to what you say, to what you do,

457
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:45,584
that you can't buy yourself out of with money.

458
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,004
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

459
00:37:52,592 --> 00:37:53,884
You have to trust me, Eli.

460
00:37:54,427 --> 00:37:55,761
What does that mean?

461
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,850
- That blood is thicker than water.
- Yeah?

462
00:38:02,811 --> 00:38:05,145
Well, why'd it have to be my blood?

463
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,772
Happy days, boys, happy days.

464
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:09,650
Edgar Caldwell from campaign headquarters.

465
00:38:12,862 --> 00:38:14,488
Let me take this.

466
00:38:23,832 --> 00:38:24,999
Hello.

467
00:38:32,966 --> 00:38:35,509
Frank Hague! What, did they run you out of Jersey City?

468
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:37,011
Who let the Democrat in?

469
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:40,431
You don't gotta be Irish to march in the St. Patty's Day parade, do you?

470
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,225
No, but it helps. Come on.

471
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:44,935
Good to see you.

472
00:38:45,228 --> 00:38:49,857
Gentlemen and fellow Republicans, may I have your attention, please?

473
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:52,943
I have just been informed that as of three minutes ago,

474
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:55,779
Atlantic City has a new mayor.

475
00:38:55,864 --> 00:38:57,114
Mr. Edward Bader.

476
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:01,452
Congratulations.

477
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,332
Thank you one and all for your kind applause and your generous support.

478
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:11,670
Now, being a man of action, I feel I should get right down to business.

479
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:13,964
Sheriff Halloran.

480
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:15,632
At your service, Mr. Mayor.

481
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:20,137
Sheriff Halloran, after your long and meritorious service to Atlantic City,

482
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:22,848
I regretfully accept your resignation.

483
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,145
Is this a joke?

484
00:39:28,772 --> 00:39:30,981
Relax, kid. It's what Nucky wants.

485
00:39:33,735 --> 00:39:37,362
And now, as my second official act as mayor, it is my pleasure

486
00:39:37,447 --> 00:39:41,992
to reappoint my good friend Eli Thompson as sheriff of Atlantic County.

487
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:43,660
- Hear, hear.
- Hear.

488
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:48,290
Welcome back, Eli.

489
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,424
Well, looks like there's a new sheriff in town.

490
00:39:57,717 --> 00:39:58,842
Jimmy.

491
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:01,261
You're looking well.

492
00:40:02,388 --> 00:40:04,681
Good old Paddy Ryan,

493
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:07,059
chief clerk of the fourth ward.

494
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,061
How you been?

495
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:11,230
I'm aces, Paddy.

496
00:40:11,314 --> 00:40:13,273
How's life in politics?

497
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:14,525
Swell.

498
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:17,027
Nuck's taking good care of me.

499
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:20,864
He must have pimped out your mother as well.

500
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:22,908
I beg your pardon?

501
00:40:22,992 --> 00:40:26,286
Your mother, he must have pimped your mother out as...

502
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:30,040
What the fuck is wrong with you?

503
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,416
What?

504
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:35,003
Nothing.

505
00:40:37,006 --> 00:40:38,549
You're my hero.

506
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:40,050
What are you talking about?

507
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:43,762
The way you work, Nuck, you're like a machine.

508
00:40:44,514 --> 00:40:47,683
Clean, fast, totally devoid of any emotion.

509
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:48,809
Halloran wasn't working out.

510
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:51,186
Halloran? You'll use anyone, Nuck.

511
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:54,064
Man, woman, 13-year-old girl.

512
00:40:57,235 --> 00:40:59,027
She was an orphan, James.

513
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:00,904
Living in a home for wayward children.

514
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,574
- The Commodore took good care of her.
- I'll bet he did.

515
00:41:03,992 --> 00:41:05,450
And then you took care of me.

516
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:07,995
Well, I did, didn't I?

517
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,746
Did you ever want for anything?

518
00:41:09,831 --> 00:41:12,374
Need anything? You ever miss a meal?

519
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:24,303
So the learning at your feet, getting me into Princeton,

520
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,847
that was all guilt? Huh?

521
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,473
Guilt, duty.

522
00:41:28,558 --> 00:41:31,185
You're a grown man now. What difference does it make?

523
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:35,147
I thought you loved me.

524
00:41:37,192 --> 00:41:39,276
I'm not your father, James.

525
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:43,405
You're right.

526
00:41:43,489 --> 00:41:45,365
I'm going to go take it up with him.

527
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:48,410
Why don't you do yourself a favor?

528
00:41:48,494 --> 00:41:50,829
Go home to your wife and sober up.

529
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:53,540
Why don't you do me a favor, Nuck?

530
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:57,002
Stop acting like you give a shit.

531
00:42:06,763 --> 00:42:11,975
Come on now, everyone, eat your cake. We still haven't found the surprises.

532
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:17,648
- Anything in there?
- No.

533
00:42:24,197 --> 00:42:25,489
The ring.

534
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:28,408
It means I'll be married, right?

535
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:31,453
May it bring you better luck than it did me.

536
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:34,831
The First Lady of the United States.

537
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:47,177
What will you do, Nan, if he doesn't send for you?

538
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:54,351
Well, of course he will. He said.

539
00:42:57,355 --> 00:42:59,523
I didn't get a prize.

540
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:03,277
Well, there's still more cake left, dear.

541
00:43:07,532 --> 00:43:08,532
The rag.

542
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:13,537
What does that mean, Mama?

543
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:20,085
Nothing, dear. It's just a silly superstition.

544
00:43:39,063 --> 00:43:40,063
Sir.

545
00:43:40,398 --> 00:43:42,482
There's some woman out front. She's looking for you.

546
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:45,485
Send her in.

547
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,189
I went to your rooming house.

548
00:44:22,565 --> 00:44:24,858
The landlady told me you worked here.

549
00:44:25,902 --> 00:44:27,861
What do you want?

550
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:34,451
You a postman, Nelson?

551
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,330
No, I'm a Prohibition Agent.

552
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:42,459
Hmm.

553
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:48,757
Well, you made me pregnant.

554
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:02,479
- Come on now. Warm milk.
- No.

555
00:45:04,982 --> 00:45:06,900
Put a little brandy in it, would you?

556
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:09,444
We're trying to rebuild your stomach lining.

557
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:11,696
Well, then cook me a steak.

558
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:19,413
So we're a happy family all of a sudden?

559
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:22,833
You don't have to be so fretful all the time.

560
00:45:23,876 --> 00:45:25,168
I'll make you some eggs.

561
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,009
Jimmy, give me some of that.

562
00:45:57,201 --> 00:46:00,036
You realize this is the first time we've ever had a drink together?

563
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:02,414
Don't tell your mother.

564
00:46:07,295 --> 00:46:09,337
The woman tries to kill me

565
00:46:10,882 --> 00:46:13,550
and Nucky lets her go.

566
00:46:13,926 --> 00:46:16,887
He's got an odd sense of justice.

567
00:46:16,971 --> 00:46:18,597
Talk to me about justice?

568
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:22,517
Fucking Woodrow Wilson, when he was governor,

569
00:46:22,602 --> 00:46:24,811
goddamn southern son of a bitch

570
00:46:24,896 --> 00:46:26,730
comes here to try to make a name for himself

571
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:28,732
so he can run for president.

572
00:46:29,734 --> 00:46:31,234
He's the reason you went to jail.

573
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:36,072
No, he's the reason I got convicted. Nucky's the reason I went to jail.

574
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:44,498
What do you mean?

575
00:46:44,582 --> 00:46:46,041
Well, he was sheriff at the time.

576
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:49,294
We got caught up in some election-rigging case.

577
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:52,005
They couldn't get us both, so this fucking Wilson

578
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:54,716
makes a deal with the prosecutor.

579
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,595
One of us takes the fall, Wilson gets the headline.

580
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:00,597
The rest of the case goes away.

581
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,307
Why you and not Nucky?

582
00:47:02,391 --> 00:47:06,061
I was hurt politically and Nucky was the fair-haired boy.

583
00:47:06,395 --> 00:47:08,021
The plan was for me to go away.

584
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:11,942
He'd take over and then square things up when I got out.

585
00:47:12,193 --> 00:47:14,945
- Did he?
- He squared things up all right.

586
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:19,616
Five years in jail and I was just a distant memory.

587
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:24,788
And there he is with a diamond stick pin and a Rolls-fucking-Royce.

588
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:30,710
Nucky Thompson, the spawn of a drunken piney.

589
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,819
I used to hate coming here when I was a kid.

590
00:47:56,445 --> 00:47:59,239
My mother would bring me here to see you.

591
00:48:01,492 --> 00:48:03,159
I know.

592
00:48:03,578 --> 00:48:05,996
I was afraid of all the animals.

593
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:08,790
I was afraid of you.

594
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:12,460
Nucky told me, "It's your duty.

595
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,671
"Gotta be strong for your mother."

596
00:48:15,673 --> 00:48:17,966
Manipulative son of a bitch.

597
00:48:19,844 --> 00:48:21,177
He can be.

598
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:28,893
Jimmy,

599
00:48:30,354 --> 00:48:34,858
you think I don't know why he brought you back from Chicago?

600
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,695
To do what he doesn't have the stomach for.

601
00:48:39,864 --> 00:48:41,781
And you said yes.

602
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:43,325
What for?

603
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:46,703
- A few percent off top?
- I made a good deal.

604
00:48:47,038 --> 00:48:49,789
God, he made you think you did.

605
00:48:49,874 --> 00:48:51,625
He made me think I did.

606
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:53,668
That's the way he operates.

607
00:48:54,503 --> 00:48:55,503
You know him well.

608
00:48:55,588 --> 00:48:57,922
He was like a son to me.

609
00:48:58,507 --> 00:49:01,176
But you're my flesh and blood, boy.

610
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:05,221
So?

611
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:10,518
So you're gonna take back Atlantic City for the both of us.

612
00:49:13,314 --> 00:49:15,899
And how is that supposed to work?

613
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:18,193
Look around, son.

614
00:49:19,153 --> 00:49:21,780
I didn't get all this by being stupid.

615
00:49:26,077 --> 00:49:27,243
Sir.

616
00:49:40,966 --> 00:49:42,467
You told him what we discussed?

617
00:49:43,636 --> 00:49:45,303
I'm just about to.

618
00:49:52,645 --> 00:49:56,147
So, you see, if I were president, I'd run the country like a Broadway show.

619
00:49:56,857 --> 00:50:00,193
I'd pick my cabinet and try them out right here in Atlantic City.

620
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:04,239
Oh, yes, the best audiences.

621
00:50:04,323 --> 00:50:05,448
And if they clicked here,

622
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:08,368
I'd let them open in New York and a few other cities.

623
00:50:09,995 --> 00:50:14,249
We'd do one-night stands for four years and by then they'd have to re-elect me

624
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:17,627
so I could actually do something at the White House.

625
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:54,914
Mr. Thompson. Mr. Thompson.

626
00:50:57,251 --> 00:50:58,460
How do you do?

627
00:50:59,462 --> 00:51:01,713
Baxter, it's nice to see you.

628
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:05,175
I see you've met Annabelle.

629
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:07,552
George was telling me all about the cutlery business.

630
00:51:07,636 --> 00:51:10,597
Yeah, I'll knife you and spoon you and fork you as well.

631
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:16,102
How about a dance?

632
00:52:02,942 --> 00:52:04,901
- Margaret.
- Hello.

633
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:08,655
What a pleasant surprise.

634
00:52:10,908 --> 00:52:13,409
I heard the news about Mayor Bader.

635
00:52:13,536 --> 00:52:14,702
Congratulations.

636
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:17,622
Well, I certainly owe a debt of gratitude to you.

637
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:20,083
Then you could offer me a drink.

638
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:25,338
Is champagne okay?

639
00:52:26,298 --> 00:52:29,175
Good news just isn't the same without it.

640
00:52:39,979 --> 00:52:41,145
How are the children?

641
00:52:44,066 --> 00:52:46,526
They miss their Uncle Nucky.

642
00:52:50,155 --> 00:52:52,657
Quiet, everyone! Quiet. Quiet.

643
00:52:52,741 --> 00:52:54,450
We got it on the wireless. Quiet.

644
00:52:54,535 --> 00:53:00,623
Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Florida, Michigan,

645
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:04,043
North Carolina and Rhode Island.

646
00:53:04,295 --> 00:53:07,255
Once again, ladies and gentlemen, this is Frank Conrad

647
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:09,048
with the official results of the election

648
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:11,634
transmitting live over the wireless from Pittsburgh.

649
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:13,303
Pittsburgh! Can you believe it?

650
00:53:13,762 --> 00:53:14,762
Pipe down, lady.

651
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:20,059
With 48 states reporting, it's Warren Harding with nearly 60% of the popular vote.

652
00:53:21,061 --> 00:53:23,062
Yes, yes, and this just in.

653
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,149
Challenger James M. Cox has moments ago conceded

654
00:53:26,317 --> 00:53:28,943
to a capacity crowd at Dayton Fairgrounds.

655
00:53:29,028 --> 00:53:31,321
Ladies and gentlemen, Warren Gamaliel Harding

656
00:53:31,405 --> 00:53:34,657
has been elected the 29th president of the United States!

657
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:50,965
What a momentous evening this has been for the senator from Ohio.

658
00:53:51,175 --> 00:53:54,594
His decisive victory a credit to both himself

659
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:57,347
and to the entire Republican party.

660
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:01,559
And now this, from Mr. Harding's acceptance speech.

661
00:54:01,644 --> 00:54:04,437
I read to you directly from the ticker.

662
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:09,567
"My countrymen, America's present need is not heroics, but healing.

663
00:54:10,402 --> 00:54:12,820
"Not revolution, but restoration.

664
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,032
"Not agitation, but adjustment.

665
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:19,327
"Not surgery, but serenity.

666
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:22,830
"Not the dramatic, but the dispassionate.

667
00:54:22,915 --> 00:54:25,041
"The world calls for peace.

668
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:28,836
"We need not nostrums, but a return to normalcy."

669
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:31,537
Thank you, Babette. Thank you, Nucky.

670
00:58:31,955 --> 00:58:33,581
Thank you, Nucky.

671
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:36,500
Thank you.

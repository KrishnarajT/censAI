1
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:43,728
- Let's take it to the lighthouse.
- Absolutely.

2
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,688
- Show the way!
- Come on.

3
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,743
- It's the liquidators.
- Really?

4
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,453
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:21,516
Say, fat chops, you got the time?
Or did you eat your pocket watch?

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,976
- Bug off, you little shit.
- Fuck you.

7
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,146
Son of a bitch!

8
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,609
Come here, you little guinea bastard.

9
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,319
Come back here.

10
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,906
I'm gonna kick the shit... Get over here.

11
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,435
Was that nice, Daddy?

12
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:07,979
Mmm.

13
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,524
Who makes you feel good?

14
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,276
You do, kid.

15
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,654
Me and nobody else?

16
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,119
'Cause I see how the other girls look at you.

17
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,162
Mmm.

18
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,124
But I'm your little tiger cub.

19
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,462
Hmm?

20
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:43,014
You just make me want
to run around the jungle.

21
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,433
And...

22
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,437
Pounce!

23
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,523
Jesus!

24
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,734
What the hell's wrong with you?

25
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,111
I'm your little tiger.

26
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,655
Then I should use a goddamn whip.

27
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,242
Don't be mad, Daddy.

28
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,788
I can't help it. You just make me wild.

29
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,916
I'm fucking bleeding.

30
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,336
- Can I put some gauze on it?
- Forget it.

31
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,714
Just don't get so carried away. Huh?

32
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,785
Mrs. Schroeder.

33
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,540
I was wondering if we might speak
about a private matter.

34
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,096
Yes, of course.

35
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,141
A man has made me an offer.

36
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,810
Of what nature?

37
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,730
Financial? Domestic? Sexual?

38
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,400
Yes.

39
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,236
Who is he?

40
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,864
He runs things.

41
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,204
He'll provide for me and my children.

42
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,081
Will he marry you?

43
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,209
I wouldn't think so.

44
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,381
There are various words
for that sort of woman,

45
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,591
none of them are flattering.

46
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,928
He'll provide, ma'am.

47
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,893
Do you know why I live in Atlantic City?

48
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,856
- No.
- Mr. McGarry owned a quarter interest

49
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,608
in an oilfield in Titusville, Pennsylvania.

50
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:05,531
A man from the Standard Oil Company
made him a large cash offer for his share.

51
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:11,871
And so Mr. McGarry built a 16-room mansion
on the shore.

52
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,625
Six months later he was dead of influenza.

53
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,963
I now live in a smaller house
on Raleigh Avenue.

54
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,673
It suits my needs

55
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,886
and I have the freedom to devote myself
to matters I consider important.

56
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,055
The Movement.

57
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,224
Temperance was meant
to protect women, Margaret,

58
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,145
but the ballot box will free us.

59
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,733
Only one more state for complete ratification.

60
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,652
I've no mansion to sell, ma'am.

61
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,865
Which is why you must do as you see fit.

62
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,827
You owe no one else an explanation.

63
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,755
This contains useful knowledge.

64
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,382
I highly recommend that you read it.

65
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,457
Give me one of those.

66
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,725
How about you call in sick tonight?

67
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,687
Don't you ever get tired?

68
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,398
Not with you, I don't.

69
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,568
Like you do with the other girls.

70
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,656
- Not tired exactly.
- No?

71
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,950
What is it then?

72
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,786
It's nothin'.

73
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,584
It don't work.

74
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,378
That horse cock? Please.

75
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,172
I'm serious.

76
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,966
You're the first broad in years
who put any lead in my pencil at all.

77
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,844
- You don't have to flatter me, dear.
- I ain't. Honest injun.

78
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,513
Couple years ago
I had an affliction down there.

79
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,724
It got better, but then...

80
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,351
I don't know.

81
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,187
It just didn't work no more.

82
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,898
Then you met me.

83
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,152
And then I met you.

84
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Yeah?

85
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,797
What kind of way is that
to answer a telephone?

86
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,133
- A.R.
- So?

87
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,845
I gather you haven't made it up to Saratoga.

88
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,971
Yeah, no, not yet.

89
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,684
- How'd you know where I was?
- I have a crystal ball, Charlie. You know that.

90
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,770
I see

91
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,606
you're not wearing your trousers.

92
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,278
So what gives?

93
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,615
I've been waiting for a report on Mr. Darmody.

94
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,783
Right.

95
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,994
Yeah, well I can't really speak to that now.

96
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,457
I wouldn't think so, considering the company
you've been keeping.

97
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,877
Can I call you back?
I'm with his wife right now.

98
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,838
No, you're not, Charlie.

99
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,341
You're with his mother.

100
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,645
A kid and a skinny fella
in broad daylight on the boards.

101
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,690
I'm still thunderstruck. In this day and age.

102
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,984
They're not from your ward,
you're sure about that?

103
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,070
No, I know every tick
on the hind of every dog.

104
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,532
Maybe over to Boyd's turf.
They had a dago look.

105
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,534
And what look is that?

106
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,370
Feebleminded.

107
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,789
I'll get the boys cracking, Nuck.

108
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,626
If there's a nickel of your money
in a nun's cooze, we'll shake it loose.

109
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,045
Why don't we let Eli handle it?

110
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,338
And put a steak on that.

111
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,271
On the Boardwalk, Eli,
100 yards from my suite.

112
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,483
And laying in wait, too, obviously.
That was his last stop.

113
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,320
Nobody from A.C. Would be dumb enough
to pull a stunt like this.

114
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,405
These fuckin' Italians though,

115
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,407
they don't respect the rules.

116
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,831
Luciano, is he still hanging around?

117
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,084
- Who?
- Rothstein's torpedo, the greaseball.

118
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,463
I'll give you three to one
he's either behind this or knows who is.

119
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,089
So is he?

120
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,591
Is he what?

121
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,509
- Hanging around!
- He comes and goes.

122
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,678
I got other fish to fry besides him.

123
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,763
Well, fry them already!

124
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,057
I don't want this happening ever again

125
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,352
where some guinea pissant
gets the idea that he...

126
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,355
Knock, God damn it.

127
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,522
I did.

128
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,690
Well, knock like a man.

129
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,400
I think I should not disturb you.

130
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,611
- Then why are you?
- Frank Hague,

131
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,280
- the mayor of Jersey City...
- I know who the fuck he is.

132
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,531
He wishes to tell you

133
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,118
he has spent several nights waiting
at the Hotel Shelburne.

134
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,538
He does not wish to spend many more.

135
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,624
Unless you see him soon...

136
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,881
"There are many roads to Rome,

137
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,551
"but there will be
only one through New Jersey."

138
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,805
Set up a dinner or something.

139
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,727
And you bring that dago in.

140
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,995
Careful. What if you miss?

141
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,831
The trick is not to, so I don't.

142
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,252
Are you fucking crazy?

143
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,507
Over there you never played five-finger fillet?

144
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,678
We did. I'm just sayin',

145
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,348
we were more interested in winning the war.

146
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,018
Go ahead.

147
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,563
For old times.

148
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,943
Johnny's coming.

149
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,460
Hey, Johnny, how you doing?

150
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,004
I got a cracked molar is how I'm doing.

151
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,716
- Did you see a dentist?
- For what?

152
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,635
Might as well yank it out yourself, right?

153
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,391
We're sitting down with Sheridan,
getting outta Greektown.

154
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,355
- How come?
- I gave you the chance.

155
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,150
I don't need the money,
I don't need the aggravation.

156
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,111
It was a... Whattaya? An oversight, that's all.

157
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,197
You wanna put me in a war?

158
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,824
That's why I brung you out
from fucking Brooklyn?

159
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,244
You watch the door. You drive my car.

160
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,788
And you.

161
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,957
Are you smart?

162
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,043
Are you?

163
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,380
Go clean the Buick.

164
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,016
Fucking micks. No offense.

165
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:16,480
They crawl up outta the bog, come in here,
my house, and spill blood

166
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,941
'cause that one don't know
how to do business.

167
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,651
I think it's a mistake, Johnny.

168
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,403
What's with this Johnny shit?

169
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,863
Mr. Torrio.

170
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,282
To get out of Greektown completely.

171
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,661
We made headway at that bar, Anastos'.

172
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,207
- What kinda money did that joint bring in?
- Good.

173
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,125
Not great, but it's a foothold.

174
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,171
I know you don't want a war,

175
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,632
but retreating?

176
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,926
How does that look?

177
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,310
We should talk to them, Mr. Torrio.

178
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,188
We should come to an understanding.

179
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,692
What's that supposed to mean?

180
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,075
I wish I'd known you were coming, sir.
I would have prepared something.

181
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,163
It's a surprise field office review, Nelson.
Lack of notice is precisely the point.

182
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,082
Of course.

183
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,002
I told you this isn't a damn storage room.

184
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,169
Clear out!

185
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:30,470
The report I mentioned in my wire, sir.
I had planned to mail it.

186
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,681
Well, you certainly have plenty of stamps.

187
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,353
You're placing Enoch Thompson
at the head of a criminal organization

188
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,272
controlling Atlantic County.

189
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,941
I believe I've established
a pervasive pattern of illegality

190
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,527
as it relates to alcohol
with him at the very center.

191
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,363
Where are the financial records?

192
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:52,200
The corroborating witnesses?
What do I take to the District Attorney?

193
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,453
I'm asking for the resources
to build that case.

194
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,246
I need numbers, Nelson!

195
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,582
Bottles broken by the thousand,

196
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,959
trucks, boats and stills seized
and put out of commission.

197
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,753
There's also a capital crime there.

198
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,297
I don't see it.

199
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,508
Thompson sent James Darmody
to steal back a shipment of whiskey

200
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,302
he sold to Arnold Rothstein.

201
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,389
Darmody and an unnamed
accomplice executed five men.

202
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,225
Then Thompson pinned the murders
on Hans Schroeder.

203
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,020
What is this obsession
with the Schroeder character?

204
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,147
Sir?

205
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,067
You requisitioned the immigration file
on his wife?

206
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,407
I'm only being thorough, sir.

207
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,661
You're a Prohibition agent,
not Bulldog Drummond.

208
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,415
Bring me numbers.

209
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,679
What time is it?

210
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,515
About half three.

211
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,020
3:30.

212
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,983
It's 3:30, bearcat. Get a wiggle on.

213
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,819
Don't go overboard.

214
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,446
You don't want me to sound American.

215
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,491
No, I don't think I do.

216
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:18,620
An Irish maiden, that's what you'd like.

217
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,873
And what would you like?

218
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,376
I haven't thought about it.

219
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,586
That's a lot of bunk.

220
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,675
What'll my neighbors say?

221
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,220
They're not gonna be
your neighbors anymore.

222
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,015
Do you give all the widows new flats?

223
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,601
I help out where I can.

224
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,525
And what happened here?

225
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,070
A hunting accident.

226
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,615
Who was hunting whom?

227
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,079
I have to pick up the children

228
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,874
- and get back to work.
- No, you don't.

229
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,585
And then what am I?

230
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,712
Are you sure I can't slice something,
peel something?

231
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,048
You're a guest.
You get up and I'll break your legs.

232
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,175
What's he saying?

233
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,259
Nothing. He wants to help.

234
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,596
Al told me about your friend.
Poor girl down at the restaurant?

235
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,681
Pearl. The waitress.

236
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:04,518
Right. Yeah.

237
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:08,230
Such a tragedy. My God!
To get hit by a streetcar.

238
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,858
You want to talk to that driver,
make sure he's more careful in the future.

239
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,151
Yeah.

240
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,530
How many links, Princeton?

241
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,532
Uh... Just one will do.

242
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,075
I'll give you three.

243
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,619
He's a grown man, Al.
He knows what he wants.

244
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,205
And he'll take what I give him.

245
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,124
Sonny?

246
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,085
Leave him. He's in his own world.

247
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,422
Sonny, dinner.

248
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,759
Fucking kid.

249
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,596
Come on, baby. Time to eat.

250
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,765
Make some coffee.

251
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,185
Did that stupid Irish cow break
her arms?

252
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,272
You know, I may not talk Italian,
but I know what stupido means.

253
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,113
Some house I got.

254
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:02,450
A guinea for a mother,
a mick for a wife and a dumbbell for a son.

255
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:03,869
Don't call him that.

256
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,787
I got a little boy myself at home.

257
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,039
Yeah? Do you have a likeness?

258
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,459
Not with me.
He's a little guy, dark eyes like his mom.

259
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,420
A real chatterbox.

260
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,547
But he comes
when you call him at least, huh?

261
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,383
Mostly. He's got a mind of his own though.

262
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,846
You like your eggs, Sonny?

263
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,642
I told you. He's a dopey little bastard.

264
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,108
Mama.

265
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,032
I got it. I got it, okay?

266
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,775
How about this?

267
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,613
No.

268
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,074
Perhaps Madame could
describe it better to me.

269
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,368
Why does anybody buy underwear?

270
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:30,246
Some women wish to hide,
others wish to reveal.

271
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,875
Well, I want it in lights.

272
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,003
Something vampy

273
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,381
and sheer,

274
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,842
with a cutout right here.

275
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,888
A moment please.

276
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,267
You got some job, sister.

277
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,311
I've done worse.

278
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,271
I bet you have.

279
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,109
And voilà.

280
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,831
I want to see what it looks like.

281
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,916
On her.

282
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,491
You don't wear a brassiere?

283
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,330
I've tried them. They're not comfortable.

284
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,832
You should try again. You're saggy.

285
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,128
You've had children. You can tell.

286
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,008
You look like the kitchen help.

287
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,887
A quickie bent over the table.

288
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,474
He doesn't seem to mind.

289
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,854
You don't know very much, do you?

290
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,898
You'd be surprised.

291
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,693
They raised him a good Catholic boy.

292
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,906
And every once in a while

293
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,618
he starts thinking he might go to hell,

294
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,288
and that he'd better change
before it's too late.

295
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,708
But all I gotta do is this.

296
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,088
And this.

297
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,390
And then he doesn't feel so Catholic anymore.

298
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,354
When I was a girl in Ireland,

299
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,523
a raggedy man would
come round every spring

300
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,817
with a little bantam rooster.

301
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,736
He'd trained it to peck
out The Mountains of Mourne

302
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,573
on a toy piano that hung off his chest.

303
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,241
So?

304
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:56,327
Well, the first year he came,

305
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,623
we, all of us, the girls in that place,
we thought it magical.

306
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,669
The second year,
we laughed behind our hands

307
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,963
at the odd man in his tatters.

308
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,091
And the third year, we didn't even go.

309
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,845
Because The Mountains of Mourne
was all that little rooster could ever do.

310
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,431
So what's the point?

311
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,769
That maybe your cunny
isn't quite the draw you think it is.

312
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,196
I quit.

313
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,805
Thank you.

314
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,974
Let me help you, Mr. Kessler.

315
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,517
No, no, please.

316
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,814
Come, children, come.

317
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,956
Emily, Teddy, be careful.
Don't break anything.

318
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,333
They break, it will be fixed.

319
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,004
The kitchen has food to start.

320
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,426
The dining, a bathroom.

321
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:40,014
Upstairs there is a room for the boy,
a room for the girl

322
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,016
and the master bedroom.

323
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,310
It's very beautiful.

324
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,355
Yes, good. Missus, I go now.

325
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,316
Do I wait for Mr. Thompson?

326
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,610
Oh, he will call.

327
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,571
Is he nice to you, Mr. Kessler?

328
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,449
Nucky? Yes, he is nice.

329
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,911
Mr. Thompson is a very nice man.

330
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,415
Are you trying to sass me,
you greasy cocksucker?

331
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,084
I thought you was all about manners.

332
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,296
I treat people as gentlemen
until they prove otherwise.

333
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,298
All you've proven
is you're a thieving little prick

334
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,674
who shows up where he doesn't belong.

335
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,801
Since when do you need
permission to look at the ocean?

336
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,553
To look at my ocean?

337
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,473
Since your boss tried to lift
100 grand out of my pocket.

338
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,475
Mr. Rothstein don't see it that way.

339
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,769
Mr. Rothstein don't run this town.

340
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,855
No, he runs New York. Maybe you heard of it.

341
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,440
You like it around here though, do you?

342
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,360
I like the view between that geisha's legs.

343
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,909
You're referring to Gillian Darmody?

344
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,579
Is that her name?

345
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,211
I'll fucking bury this in your fucking head.

346
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,425
Get the fuck off me!

347
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:13,983
Mrs. Darmody is free to do as she pleases,
not always to her benefit.

348
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:20,281
But I strongly suggest you treat her
in every particular with the utmost regard.

349
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,207
Charles, right?

350
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,418
Lucky.

351
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,797
Everything you see here, it's mine.

352
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,550
Buy a drink, place a bet,
ride the fucking Ferris wheel.

353
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,094
- And if you steal...
- I ain't took nothing.

354
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:45,431
If you steal, Charles, from my men,

355
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,226
you steal from me.

356
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,604
So tell the pack of guineas
you came down here with

357
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,357
and tell your boss in New York.

358
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,150
I don't know what you're talking about.

359
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,570
Jesus Christ!

360
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,240
What the fuck are you doing?

361
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,242
You said to knock in a manly fashion.

362
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,077
Well, leave the door on the hinges.

363
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,412
What do you want?

364
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,496
Mrs. Schroeder.

365
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,665
Yes?

366
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,709
Is very happy with the accommodations.

367
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,546
Good.

368
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,340
You can go.

369
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:24,178
Thank you very much, Mr. Thompson,
for showing me how it's done here.

370
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,787
It's open.

371
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,296
Hey, Kit.

372
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:02,717
You don't really want to be in here
all by yourself, do you?

373
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,848
I think I do.

374
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,189
She left this

375
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,398
in my room.

376
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,235
Thanks.

377
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,571
Hey. Come down and sit with us.

378
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,406
I will.

379
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,909
A few minutes.

380
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,631
She's not there.

381
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,343
You're looking for that one? She's gone.

382
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,179
You are?

383
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,015
Edith Mauer.

384
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:15,600
Mrs.

385
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:16,684
Mrs. Mauer,

386
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,686
where is she?

387
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,980
Off drinking champagne,
I wouldn't be surprised.

388
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,857
Why do you say that?

389
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,443
She's out all hours.

390
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,361
Expects me to watch over her brats.

391
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,405
And she works for French people.

392
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,198
The Ritz.

393
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,659
Nothing but the best for her.

394
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,661
Pretty high opinion of herself?

395
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,039
Butter wouldn't melt.

396
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,541
And not four months a widow.

397
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,877
He was a lovely man.

398
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,128
Mr. Schroeder?

399
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,464
- He always brought us the day-old crullers.
- Mmm.

400
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,966
- And just now...
- Yeah?

401
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:52,345
...a blue limousine pulls up
and carts them off, her and her children.

402
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,347
- A Rolls?
- How's that?

403
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,098
The limousine. A Rolls-Royce?

404
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,726
It certainly was.

405
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,732
She did something wrong, didn't she?

406
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,154
Is there anything else you can tell me?

407
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,238
Yes.

408
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,116
She's a whore.

409
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,252
Mae Murray, that's who you look like.

410
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,089
- You really think so?
- Sure I do.

411
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,591
The Taming of Kaiser Bull.

412
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,135
Maybe I'll take you to the pictures.

413
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,777
Classy. Huh?

414
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,739
I was a kid, there was a sign outside,
"No dogs or Irish."

415
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,449
Now I can buy this fucking joint.

416
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,952
You're an inspiration to us all.

417
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,662
Go on, search them.

418
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,374
After the stunt you pulled,
you don't trust me?

419
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,667
No, I don't.

420
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,920
They're clean.

421
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:24,019
Tip her good. She's a real beauty, this one.

422
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,439
Thanks.

423
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,065
Any time.

424
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,609
So?

425
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,236
So what?

426
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,739
- Now we search you fellas.
- It was you called this meet,

427
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,906
not me.

428
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,075
And I'll tell youse right now.
I am packing heat.

429
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,786
- We all are.
- No, that wasn't the deal.

430
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,788
You want to hash this out or not?

431
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,582
I don't like this, Johnny.

432
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,666
If I wanted to kill youse,

433
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,002
you wouldn't have made it
through the front door.

434
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,840
All right.

435
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,886
Relax. Everything's gonna be fine.

436
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,569
Sorry for the ruckus,
but ask anybody who knows me,

437
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,030
Charlie Sheridan ain't a fella
takes a threat lying down.

438
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,657
We were expanding our reach.
It wasn't so much a threat.

439
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,951
Dipping our toes in the water.

440
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,079
And youse got all wet.
At least your whore did.

441
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,040
She was 18-years-old.

442
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,625
What?

443
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,294
The girl.

444
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,254
So youse want to get sentimental?

445
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,799
Anastos, the Greek fella youse beat on?

446
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,217
You cracked his jaw.

447
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,052
He can't eat regular for another month.

448
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,845
Let's just say the whole thing

449
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,307
was an unfortunate series
of misunderstandings.

450
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,394
Fine.

451
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,816
I'm sorry about the girl.

452
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,571
Your mug, Liam,

453
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,449
it'd be nice to hear that from him.

454
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:01,826
Liam works for me.

455
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:06,163
I told him to pick a whore and he did,
in order so's I could make my point.

456
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:09,291
And you did, and it's done. Over.

457
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,420
Let's talk turkey.

458
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,756
Fine.

459
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,469
In the interest of keeping good relations,

460
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,347
I'll give youse a three-block territory

461
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,684
starting on Hallstead,
between Randolph and Monroe.

462
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,770
There's some good joints there, real busy.
You should make a decent buck.

463
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,314
The rest of the delta,

464
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,108
meaning anything between Harrison...

465
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,153
Ho! What the fuck?

466
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,572
Nobody fucking move.

467
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,031
- Easy.
- His boot!

468
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,284
The fuck's he got in there?

469
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,494
It's a knife.

470
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,123
I thought you fucking searched them.

471
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,302
You sneak a blade into a meet.

472
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,095
What the fuck you trying to pull?

473
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,930
You fellas got guns.

474
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:08,100
I forgot I had it on me. I'm sorry.

475
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,939
Maybe I cut your throat with it.

476
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,817
Next time you'll remember.

477
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,246
What's this?

478
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,584
It's called a skull crusher.

479
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,463
It's for cracking walnuts.

480
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,884
I'll crack a few with it, let you know.

481
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,011
Let's have a drink.

482
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,348
Let bygones be bygones, all around.

483
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,663
- I'm gonna visit the head.
- I'll bring the car around.

484
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,584
- Thanks, sweetie. Here's for you.
- Thanks.

485
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,211
What happened to the blonde?

486
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,254
She's on coffee break.

487
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:33,894
Thank you.

488
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:42,444
Christ!

489
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,700
Come on, wrap it up.

490
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,910
- Come on.
- You prick.

491
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,370
Fuck.

492
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,080
Go, get out of here, go!

493
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,923
You piece of shit. Come here.

494
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,094
I think you'd agree that
Greektown belongs to us now.

495
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,604
Come on.

496
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,683
What are you up to in there?

497
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,643
Are you ill?

498
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,354
I was luxuriating.

499
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,775
I like making you happy.

500
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:09,531
Thank you.

501
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,202
And

502
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,621
thank you.

503
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,631
That'll take some getting used to.

504
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,722
Hello.

505
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,265
Yeah.

506
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,643
God damn it.

507
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,355
Tell him I'm on my way.

508
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,567
- Is something wrong?
- Just business.

509
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,281
You know who Hardeen is?

510
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,284
- Should I?
- He's Houdini's brother.

511
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,828
But he's just as good.

512
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,455
He's opening tonight at the Globe.

513
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,706
I have to turn up.

514
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,043
- Business again, is it?
- Partly.

515
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,379
I'd like you to come with me.

516
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,630
See the act.

517
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,299
We'll have a light supper with him after,
just us.

518
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,218
With Mr. Hardeen?

519
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,262
His wife maybe, too.

520
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,513
At the Marlborough.

521
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,306
These show people,

522
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,892
some of them are a lot of fun.

523
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,396
Houdini's brother.

524
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,898
Does he escape from things as well?

525
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,402
I'll bet he escapes from the dinner check.

526
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,002
Sorry, fellas. Private party.

527
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:48,213
Pick a gal though. Enjoy yourselves.

528
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,760
He's a genius, this kid.

529
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,429
Fucking strategy.

530
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,181
They'd come after us eventually.

531
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,725
"Us"? So you're sticking around?

532
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,979
I could use a dozen like you.

533
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,772
The balls on this mick.

534
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,692
Fucking Ruggiero.

535
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,360
Who's that?

536
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,197
The puppet with the sword. In Sicily.

537
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,165
I'd just like to say that
Jimmy Darmody's a stand-up guy.

538
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,293
When he ain't on the floor
pissin' himself, that is.

539
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,798
A few weeks ago, I'm up in his room,

540
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,550
I squeeze a shot off as a joke.

541
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,470
Next thing he's practically humping the floor.

542
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,513
Swear to God.

543
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:44,269
But you know, he was over there in France,

544
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:48,899
and I heard there wasn't one paddy
that could scrub a latrine whiter than our Jim.

545
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:54,738
Here's to him.

546
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:01,495
Not like you, huh, Captain Capone?

547
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,499
Hand-to-hand with the Kaiser himself.

548
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,880
That is how you got your scars, right, Al?

549
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,385
Unlike some of us,
I don't need to brag about what I did.

550
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,887
The Lost Battalion.

551
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:22,015
He got so lost
he thought Brooklyn was in France.

552
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,948
All week you got me cooling my heels.

553
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,285
In a deluxe suite at the Shelburne.
You don't like it?

554
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,996
I'm a simple man.

555
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,331
All I need is a bed, the love of a good woman,

556
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,125
and an envelope about so thick.

557
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,377
I made sure you got all three.

558
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,879
That you did, my host.

559
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,551
So are you gonna fight me
on this road appropriations bill?

560
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,428
I got mouths to feed up north, too.

561
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,848
There's plenty for both of us,
so let's be fair with each other.

562
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,225
You don't have enough friends
in Trenton these days?

563
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,228
I got a man I'm sending to the White House.

564
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,396
That's a friend worth having.

565
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,399
"Ladies and gentlemen,

566
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,402
"the green thumb of the Garden State,
Senator Walter Edge."

567
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,196
So he's not the great emancipator.

568
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,282
But it'll pay off for me.

569
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,326
And if the two of us shake hands
on the road money,

570
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,286
it'll pay off for you.

571
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,588
Where are we going after this?

572
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,298
Tonight?

573
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,427
You got something more important?
'Cause I can head home.

574
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,264
- You wanna see Hardeen?
- Who?

575
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:48,060
Houdini's brother, but he's just as good.
I was gonna take my girl.

576
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,187
What, I'm the third wheel?

577
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,731
I'll get you a date.

578
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,358
Only one?

579
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,117
Who is it?

580
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,466
Who's there?

581
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,706
Supposing I was the Fuller Brush salesman?

582
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,291
- What's behind your back?
- My hands.

583
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,043
Don't get cute! What are you holding?

584
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,506
What are you worried about, tough guy?

585
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:10,684
Steaks.

586
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,478
Chicago's finest. They packed them in salt.

587
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,607
When we met first time,
you said you liked 'em.

588
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,698
Do you wanna come in?

589
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,547
Drink?

590
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,593
I get stupid I drink too much,
run off at the mouth.

591
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,268
That stuff you said in front of the boys,

592
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,686
about me and the war?

593
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,730
It makes me look bad.

594
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,774
That ain't how you treat a buddy.

595
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,152
Is that what we are?

596
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,446
What did you think we were?

597
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,990
Accomplices.

598
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:10,660
It's the same thing, right?

599
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:14,664
Those steaks,

600
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,791
have one of the girls fry them up with eggs.

601
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,001
Not too long.

602
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:22,923
Or, you know, come around the house,
whenever, we'll make them there.

603
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,675
Yeah, sure.

604
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,429
Thanks.

605
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,265
Okay then.

606
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,772
He's deaf, you know.

607
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,318
My boy, Sonny.

608
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,406
I know.

609
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:52,994
It fucking kills me to think
he's being punished for the shit I done.

610
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,121
Take him to a doctor, Al.

611
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:58,291
They can't fix it. It's... It's in the blood.

612
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,630
I play the mandolin.

613
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,633
Sing to him.

614
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:11,304
Put his hand right here.

615
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,060
He feels it.

616
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,523
But he doesn't know what it is.

617
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,362
Just

618
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,656
keep at it.

619
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:34,911
Medicine now,
they're finding new things every day.

620
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,084
Hey, what's

621
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,337
a flat beer and that Sheridan prick
got in common?

622
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:47,757
No head.

623
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,180
I came up with that myself.

624
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,921
A lot of noise from a little box.

625
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,091
Which one are we talking about?

626
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,218
You're a devil at heart, Mr. Hague.

627
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,975
So what's your pleasure,
you Republican son of a bitch?

628
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,145
I want the highway.

629
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,147
Two lanes coming south from Newark,

630
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,066
and a straight shot
to the Pennsylvania border.

631
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,233
New York and Philly?

632
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,610
Can we shake on it?

633
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,579
You're putting a big bet on Walter Edge.

634
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,748
- Maybe.
- I wouldn't.

635
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:04,000
Why not?

636
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:07,253
Because he's a silent partner
in a paving company.

637
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,423
Where?

638
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:11,841
It doesn't really have an address,

639
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:15,762
but let's say it's Jersey City,
where your roads aren't.

640
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,433
Why are you telling me this, Frank?

641
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,895
'Cause guys like Edge will come and go.

642
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,856
But bosses like us?

643
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,276
We're here to stay.

644
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,582
"'Pussycat, pussycat, what did you there? '

645
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:47,752
"'I frightened a little mouse under the chair."'

646
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,923
They're usually asleep by 9:00,

647
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,092
so they shouldn't be any trouble.

648
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,845
No trouble at all. I love babies.

649
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,473
I sit for most of the other young ladies, too.

650
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,103
I don't usually...

651
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,565
I'm seeing Hardeen tonight.

652
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,650
Yes, very nice.

653
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,158
Excuse me.

654
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,622
- Hello?
- Missus.

655
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,332
Mr. Kessler.

656
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:28,877
Did I not have the time right?

657
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,045
- The time?
- Of the show.

658
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:34,048
Mr. Thompson said you'd pick me up.

659
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:37,844
Missus, Nucky wishes to say
he is busy tonight.

660
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,345
I'm sorry?

661
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,766
Tonight he has business. He said to tell you.

662
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:43,850
Oh.

663
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,394
Very well.

664
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,979
He will call.

665
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:56,780
Ma'am?

666
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,869
I'm Annabelle, your neighbor across the way?

667
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:04,788
Margaret Schroeder.

668
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:06,790
Are they yours?

669
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,291
Yes.

670
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:11,586
- Emily and Theodore.
- Hello, sweethearts.

671
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,713
- Hello.
- Aren't you gorgeous?

672
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,508
Mrs. Charlton told me
she was looking after them.

673
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,134
I was wondering if I could
throw mine in as well.

674
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,221
This is Ruby.

675
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:23,264
Go on, sugarplum,

676
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,724
meet new friends.

677
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,144
Doll is pretty.

678
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:31,439
Would you mind?
Us girls all help each other out here.

679
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:34,901
Which girls?

680
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:38,154
You know, the concubines.

681
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,616
My fella just called. He's all hot and bothered.

682
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,326
I didn't have time to make arrangements.

683
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,411
I promise I'll do the same for you.

684
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,251
Is this the three-bedroom?

685
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,838
Yes, it is.

686
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,589
Well,

687
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,843
your fella's certainly sweet on you.

688
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,799
God.

689
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,550
There you go.

690
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,888
I like that.

691
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,307
What's going on
behind those baby blues? Hmm?

692
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:17,355
I try to be good. I really do.

693
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,611
It's too late to be good tonight, dolly.

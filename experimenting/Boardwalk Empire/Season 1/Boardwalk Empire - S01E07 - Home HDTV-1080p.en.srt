1
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,121
- I'll get the breakfast special, all right?
- You got it.

2
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,832
- What'll it be?
- The usual.

3
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,501
Corned beef hash and eggs.

4
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,505
- More coffee with that?
- Sure. Thank you.

5
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,133
Hey, good to see you.

6
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,148
All right, thanks.

7
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,900
You're a credit to the force.

8
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,073
Your leg again?

9
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,909
I should've let them cut it off.

10
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,869
Well, this'll make you feel better.

11
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,247
That was my cop. Your pal Liam,

12
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,999
the mug who slashed Pearl,

13
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,587
apparently he takes his meals
at a joint on the North Side.

14
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,391
Now, I'm warning you.

15
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,644
Don't come near me, God damn it.

16
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,522
Don't come any closer to me.

17
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,192
Get back.

18
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,612
Get back, you little son of a bitch.

19
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,614
Carlisle,

20
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,241
don't make me use this.

21
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,369
That's right.

22
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,539
Hey, hey, hey. Get out, all of you. Little turds.

23
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:51,814
Ah.

24
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,075
Everybody stay back.

25
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,994
Hey!

26
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,582
Come here!

27
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:19,675
Help!

28
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,178
Where was the surgery done?

29
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,015
A field hospital outside of Verdun.

30
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,601
Three more at Walter Reed.

31
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,603
This is some fine work.

32
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,772
So why does it hurt?

33
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:37,193
The screws in the femur
could be a problem there,

34
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,695
trauma to the nerve.

35
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,656
So I got a screw loose?

36
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,741
Do you think you do?

37
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,494
It was a joke.

38
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,289
No numbness or weakness?

39
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,459
It's more of a dull ache.

40
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,336
Inside.

41
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,881
It started recently.

42
00:04:58,966 --> 00:04:59,966
Hurts like hell.

43
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,468
- How's your sleep?
- Off and on.

44
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,929
I'm up a lot.

45
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,722
What do you do?

46
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,183
I go for walks.

47
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,643
I read mostly.

48
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,062
You're employed? What do you do?

49
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,231
Oh.

50
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,650
Bell Telephone.

51
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,321
Have you ever heard
of Dr. Robert Woodworth?

52
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,824
He developed a test during the war

53
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,617
to help the soldiers.

54
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,327
We're giving it to all the men who come in.

55
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,537
What kind of test?

56
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,414
It's called a personal inventory.

57
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,790
The war is over.

58
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,292
It might be useful anyway

59
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,919
for the country.

60
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,010
"Set a high standard for a clean America."

61
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,101
What do I have to do?

62
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,437
Just answer a few questions about yourself.

63
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,731
It could help you feel better.

64
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,942
Sure, why not?

65
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,603
Try and hold still now.

66
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,146
Good God Almighty.

67
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,981
Pop, come on. One, two, three.

68
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,442
You fucking butcher.

69
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,987
Pop, just let us get you situated, okay?

70
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,575
Look who's come to pay a visit.

71
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,160
I came as soon as I heard.

72
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,163
I called your office.
Eddie said you were out with your ladyfriend.

73
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,998
Who's that? Mabel?

74
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,250
- Mabel was my wife. You know that.
- One, two, three.

75
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,211
God Almighty!

76
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,671
- Get him in there.
- Easy now.

77
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,341
- It's all right.
- Oh, God!

78
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,428
Five goddamn hours.

79
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,932
I could have lost my leg
if your brother hadn't come by.

80
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,020
Thank you, Dr. Surran.

81
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,606
All right, Mr. Thompson, here we go.

82
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,623
I'll stop by the hospital later, Pop.

83
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,886
So this woman,

84
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,557
this Margaret Schroeder.

85
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,058
Yes?

86
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,061
- What's going on there?
- She's a lovely person, Eli.

87
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,312
I'm sure she's a peach.

88
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,481
She's also a widow, remember?

89
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,733
Pretty tragic circumstances.

90
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,403
She knows nothing and she never will.

91
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,408
It smells like piss in here.

92
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:13,951
Cat piss.

93
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,578
That, too.

94
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,084
I'll call Sailor's Haven,
see if they have an extra room.

95
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,962
We can't do that.

96
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,672
Now I'm supposed to get him a private nurse?

97
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,592
June and I'll take him. He can live with us.

98
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,553
- What about your kids?
- The kids love him.

99
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,812
I suppose it is time to sell. Huh?

100
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,402
A lot of memories in this place.

101
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,700
We should give it to Fleming.

102
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,410
Let him fix it up.

103
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,996
They just had another baby,
more to come probably.

104
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Just give it to him?

105
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,333
Let some decent family

106
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,169
make a home of this shitpile.

107
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,927
Goddamn toaster.

108
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,139
It cost me nine bucks.
He never even plugged it in.

109
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,246
Who done these?

110
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,498
Ferschke over on Illinois.

111
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,459
Ink don't even stick.

112
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,919
Said he'd take $50 off.

113
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,588
I don't care he pay me. I can't use this shit.

114
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,507
Mr. White?

115
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,510
Mr. Chalky White? Hello?

116
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,762
Hello?

117
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,849
How do you do?

118
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,019
You are, I assume, Mr. White.

119
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,939
May I say it is both an honor and a privilege

120
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,024
to be making your acquaintance?

121
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,026
Fuck are you, shortpants?

122
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,737
My name is Michael Lewis.

123
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,322
I'm a businessman.

124
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,865
I have traveled here today

125
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,743
from the borough of Manhattan
in the city of New York

126
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,079
to discuss a proposition with you.

127
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:23,831
May I approach?

128
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,874
You may stay where the fuck you're standing.

129
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,550
What proposition?

130
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,850
A boy, let us say,

131
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,645
wants to buy a boiled wool coat
for his sweetheart.

132
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,859
At Gimbels this coat puts him
$12.46 out of pocket.

133
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,862
On Rivington Street
this identical coat costs what?

134
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,405
This ain't no coat store, son.

135
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,240
But the principle, you'd agree, is the same.

136
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,576
You make a certain product, yes?

137
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,328
It sells for a certain price

138
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,914
based on quality, cost, competition.

139
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,251
So what do you say, Mr. White?

140
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,546
- About what?
- About my buying, let's call it,

141
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,425
one thousand cases of spirituous liquor

142
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,260
directly from you

143
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,347
to our mutual benefit.

144
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,098
Cut out the middleman.

145
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,852
Nobody ever gotta know except you and me.

146
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,562
Precisely right.

147
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,568
Your mama know you're out
wearing your daddy's Sunday suit?

148
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,780
No sir, she does not.

149
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,783
She also doesn't know that I have this.

150
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,412
$10,000 in US currency.

151
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,331
$500 notes.

152
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,460
And all you have do
is recognize an opportunity.

153
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,145
Would you like to share the punch line?

154
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,564
Well, the punch line is
you tell Nucky Thompson

155
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,733
it's gonna take a lot more than 10 grand

156
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,652
to get me to fuck him over.

157
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,787
Well, you can't blame a fellow for trying.

158
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,582
Gentlemen.

159
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,297
So it's me, Eleanor and the baby,

160
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,050
with the thunder booming
right outside the window.

161
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,844
Next thing I know... Thanks, Nuck.

162
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,097
Next thing I know,
little Georgie, his sister and the cat

163
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,225
are all crammed in with us under the covers.

164
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,686
I tell you, a bedbug crawled in,

165
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,981
the whole megillah
would have collapsed under the weight.

166
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,693
How old's the baby now anyway?

167
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,987
A little over five months.

168
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,780
It flies, boy.

169
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,074
It was just yesterday we brought her home.

170
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,369
A scrawny little thing,
came seven weeks early.

171
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,080
I owe it all to her mom, though.

172
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,208
Night and day she fed that kid,

173
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,752
bundled her up close.

174
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,548
I swear she didn't put her down for a month.

175
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,218
Anyway, enough of my yammering.

176
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,431
No, actually
it's your family that I wanted to discuss.

177
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,683
Get off of me!

178
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,145
- He's in a very important meeting.
- Eddie, stop.

179
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,980
Why won't you return my calls?

180
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,982
- I'm so sorry.
- Lucy, I'm in a meeting.

181
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,775
I don't care. I love you.

182
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,569
What does she have that I don't have?

183
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,988
- Lucy!
- She's a fucking shopgirl.

184
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,114
Calm down, okay?

185
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,075
I left some of my clothes here.

186
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,746
I'll call you, okay? We'll have dinner.

187
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,831
I want to go to the pictures.

188
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,584
- Whatever you'd like.
- Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

189
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,461
Fine. We'll talk about it later.

190
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,173
I feel empty without you inside of me.

191
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,258
We'll talk about that as well.

192
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,562
I'm sorry about that.

193
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,986
So you're still in that flat over on Vermont?

194
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,655
We are.

195
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,657
You need a house, Damien,

196
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,534
with a yard for the kids.

197
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,536
That's the plan. We're saving up.

198
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,916
I want you to have my father's place.

199
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,585
He doesn't need it anymore
and I sure as hell don't want it.

200
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,797
That sounds great,
but we couldn't afford it yet.

201
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,299
I'm giving it to you, no strings.

202
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,469
You fix it up, make it livable.

203
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,140
Gee, Nuck, I...

204
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,809
I don't know what to say.

205
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,727
Say, "Thank you."

206
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,605
Well, thank you.

207
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,816
Thanks a million.

208
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,485
You just made Eleanor and me
about the happiest people on earth.

209
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,321
That's all I wanted to hear.

210
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,325
Sometimes I'm not sure
what he wants from me.

211
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,244
Then what's that big bed for?

212
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,288
Besides that.

213
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,298
The more important thing is
what do you want from him?

214
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,844
Well, I don't want to lose this.

215
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,598
He'll never marry you, you know.

216
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,891
I know, I know.

217
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,893
The last girl, Lucy,

218
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,854
he'd been with her for ages.

219
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,066
It would be nice to have
some certainty in our lives.

220
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,777
I've been with Harry three years now,

221
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,989
and the only certainty I've got is stashed
under a floorboard in my bedroom.

222
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,034
Almost $4,000 worth of certainty.

223
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,328
You make him pay you?

224
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,288
Not exactly.

225
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,458
Rich men can be careless with their money,

226
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,710
especially the married ones.

227
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,464
The occasional 10-spot
kited from his trousers while he's asleep.

228
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,050
It adds up after a while.

229
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,510
I could never do that.

230
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,555
You might surprise yourself someday.

231
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,849
Do you love him?

232
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,226
I'm fond of him.

233
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,145
Is he in love with you?

234
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,980
I don't think he's gotten over his wife.

235
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,358
- What does he say about her?
- Not much.

236
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,777
It's just the impression I get.

237
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,946
He's rather parsimonious with his sentiments.

238
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,659
That's probably just as well.

239
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,328
The last thing you want
is him talking too much.

240
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,829
What do you mean?

241
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,957
One thing I learned, not from Harry,
but from the one before him,

242
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,002
let them keep their secrets to themselves.

243
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,589
You let him open up and bare his soul,

244
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,468
you'll be a constant reminder
of how weak he really is.

245
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,013
Mama, come play.

246
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,848
In a minute, my dear.

247
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,393
Look at those curls.

248
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,562
Why, you'll have no trouble
getting a man at all.

249
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:14,783
Shut up.

250
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,244
Anybody got change of a nickel?

251
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,704
Oh, look who it is.

252
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,373
Last time I saw you fellas
was in back of a paddy.

253
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,084
- This is Charlie Luciano.
- And my pal Meyer.

254
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,420
- Mickey Doyle.
- How do you do?

255
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,424
He owes us money. I'd slit his throat, but
then what?

256
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,009
The goose who laid the golden egg.

257
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,553
He says you're a real solid fella.

258
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,056
Go get us a cup of something warm.

259
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,475
So why didn't you tell me
you was in town, huh?

260
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,227
- What are you doing here?
- Business.

261
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,146
Why else would I come
to this shithole by the sea?

262
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,647
Ganuzz.

263
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,991
So let me ask you,

264
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,535
how many times you think you can knock over
Nucky Thompson's bagman

265
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,786
before he bites back?

266
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,413
It was easy pickings.

267
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,081
So it was you fellas.

268
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,542
We're getting a toehold
on the alcohol business.

269
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,627
We needed a little scratch
to get things rolling.

270
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,339
That's a nice take, 3,000 clams.

271
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,883
It ain't hay.

272
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,178
You do realize you owe
Mr. Rothstein for the privilege.

273
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,682
You ain't got no jurisdiction
down in Atlantic City.

274
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,435
They came here from Philly
on their own accord.

275
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,524
Have you been noticing the cost of gasoline?

276
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,943
Last week goes from 18 to 20 cents a gallon.

277
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,613
- Who is this kike?
- The name's Meyer Lansky.

278
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,364
And he's a pal of mine, like I said.

279
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,202
Gasoline, like I said, it's what moves America.

280
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,163
Once you got the hooch,
you gotta distribute it, right?

281
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,416
You gotta set up stills,
warehouses to store the stuff,

282
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,794
payoffs for the bulls, politicians.

283
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,963
Bottles, crates, labels. It adds up.

284
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,924
You wanna run a top-shelf operation,

285
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,967
you're gonna need
a lot more than 3,000 bucks.

286
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,636
We got muscle.

287
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,304
Yeah, you and your buddies
against the whole city?

288
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,516
So what are you saying?
Is Rothstein willing to back us?

289
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,018
Show him you're capable.

290
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,020
You been to Lolly Steinman's?

291
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,606
- The delicatessen?
- It's a casino.

292
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,358
Nucky Thompson owns it.

293
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,319
End of a Saturday
they got 150 grand in the cage.

294
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,112
You fixing we rob the joint?

295
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,447
And he's the smart one.

296
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,785
We're gonna work out the details,
but 50% goes to A.R. In New York.

297
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,871
The other 50% we use
to bankroll our next move.

298
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,456
"We"?

299
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,131
Name's Billy Winslow.

300
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,218
We got him dead to rights
on an armed robbery, a jewelry store.

301
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,887
His mother's sick
and he's terrified of going to jail.

302
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,597
And why is this my concern?

303
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,349
As soon as I leveled the charges against him,

304
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,101
he started bawling like a baby.

305
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,938
Said he wanted to talk
to a Fed from Atlantic City.

306
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,953
Who are you?

307
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,706
My name is Nelson Van Alden.
I'm a special agent

308
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,667
with the Bureau of Internal Revenue
in Atlantic County.

309
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,420
This is my colleague, Agent Sebso.

310
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,546
Hello.

311
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:20,552
So I gather you've got
a story to tell, Mr. Winslow.

312
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,096
That depends. What's in it for me?

313
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,685
You're looking at 10 years
hard labor at Rahway.

314
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,314
You're not exactly in a position to bargain.

315
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,865
There was a hijacking

316
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,034
in the woods last January.

317
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,246
It was a truckload full of hooch
headed to New York.

318
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,000
They left five bodies behind.

319
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,502
How do you know this?

320
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,632
'Cause I was there as a decoy.

321
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,967
I blocked the road with my car.

322
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,887
I wasn't involved in any killing.

323
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,890
It wasn't supposed to happen like that.

324
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,351
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

325
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,186
Then why did they?

326
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,688
Look, I can give you the ringleader
and you can just ask him.

327
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,190
What's his name?

328
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,984
If I tell you, do we have a deal?
You'll get me off?

329
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,070
If you agree to testify,

330
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,365
I'll use my influence as best I can.

331
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,952
His name's

332
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,162
Jimmy Darmody.

333
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,626
It was him and this fella called Al.

334
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,888
Ronald Tineo.

335
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,057
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,105
You like to read?

337
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,528
It keeps me occupied.

338
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,737
Mmm.

339
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,864
What is the book?

340
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,076
It's...

341
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,662
Jesus!

342
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,502
It's called The Tin Soldier.

343
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,756
- It's a bunch of malarkey.
- Mmm.

344
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:29,973
Smoke?

345
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,143
Not possible.

346
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:34,936
Thomas Farina.

347
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,949
James Darmody.

348
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,617
Richard Harrow.

349
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,661
Nice to meet you.

350
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,842
Would you want this?

351
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,303
My sister sends them to me

352
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,097
because I used to enjoy 'em.

353
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,393
You don't anymore?

354
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,316
It occurred to me

355
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,818
the basis of fiction

356
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,238
is that people have some sort of connection

357
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,616
with each other.

358
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,077
But they don't.

359
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,995
Thomas Decatur.

360
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,413
That's me.

361
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,669
Thank you.

362
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,508
They're making you take the test?

363
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,010
The nutcase test? Yeah.

364
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,723
And then they'll tell us if we're normal or not.

365
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,684
I hear

366
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,355
some of the questions are embarrassing.

367
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,400
Just lie.

368
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,780
I find that difficult now.

369
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,912
They're interested in what's in our heads,

370
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,540
so that next time we'll fight better.

371
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,015
I should leave this in my room.

372
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,519
But if I don't have it with me,
I become anxious.

373
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,729
A German sniper mask.

374
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,816
I had to wait a very long time

375
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,068
for him to take it off.

376
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,821
You were a marksman?

377
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,866
I watched him

378
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,410
from a blind for three days.

379
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,330
He lifted it to scratch his nose.

380
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,708
I put a bullet

381
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,710
one inch below his eye.

382
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,546
Well,

383
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,965
fuck him, right?

384
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,592
Yeah.

385
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,937
On the test they ask

386
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,524
if you ever made love to a girl.

387
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,610
James Darmody.

388
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,780
James Darmody.

389
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,243
- He left.
- Did he say why?

390
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,622
He said he was feeling fine and then he left.

391
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,459
Durier Frost.

392
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,219
Richard Harrow.

393
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,349
He left, too.

394
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,145
Go ahead, try lying.

395
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,607
Yep, that's right.

396
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,492
More chianti?

397
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,536
You're sweeter than wine.

398
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,095
I'm still tingling.

399
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,703
What are we gonna do, Mary?

400
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:49,917
Relax.

401
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,713
It's not like he saw us together.

402
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,551
Nucky Thompson didn't get
where he is by being naive.

403
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,014
That look on his face.

404
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,267
He knows something's amiss.

405
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,604
So he knows.

406
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,856
And then what?

407
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:15,068
Well, he could stop giving me money.

408
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,282
You're so good.

409
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,459
I depend on this man.

410
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,670
What about Jimmy?

411
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,092
I would have thought he'd send something.

412
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,968
If not for me, for Tommy.

413
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,806
You just may have to get a job, my sweet.

414
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,974
I know.

415
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,979
Anything from that art dealer in New York?

416
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,314
No.

417
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,777
But Robert's friend Jonathan
is coming in town

418
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,987
to look at some real estate.

419
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,992
He works at Washington Square Gallery
in Greenwich Village.

420
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,913
He's agreed to assess your work.

421
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,542
Greenwich Village?

422
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,296
Can you imagine?

423
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,175
It's everything you've ever heard it is.

424
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,302
I can't thank you enough for coming out here
and helping me out like this.

425
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,721
Here's a little something extra
for you and the boys.

426
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,723
Make sure the guys get the beers, okay?

427
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,101
- Watch out for rusty nails.
- And don't wander off.

428
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,229
Chief Sweeney,
I see you brought the whole company.

429
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,857
- And half of Ladder 38.
- I couldn't afford it otherwise.

430
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,276
Let's hope there are no fires in town.

431
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,903
Why don't you and the boys take a breather?

432
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,405
- Mind if we take a look?
- Be my guest.

433
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,408
That's just a bunch of junk
your dad didn't want.

434
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,456
- Right there.
- Where's the 2x4?

435
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,250
The 2x4's are all piled up
over there to the right.

436
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,502
Got it.

437
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,389
So, this is it?

438
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,267
You seem surprised.

439
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,145
It's nicer than you described.

440
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,688
It is now.

441
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,149
It was filthy. Shameful actually.

442
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,611
I used to dream about fixing it up.

443
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,947
Well, it's quite cozy.

444
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,493
It's funny.
It didn't seem all that small when I was a kid.

445
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,204
Because you were small yourself.

446
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,290
I look at my father now.

447
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,417
He's this frail little man.

448
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,631
When I was a kid, he was the giant
in Jack and the Beanstalk.

449
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,050
He frightened you.

450
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,760
With good reason.

451
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,471
Does he still?

452
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,141
He can't hurt me now.

453
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,317
On my ninth birthday I made the mistake
of reaching for a piece of bread

454
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,653
ahead of my dad at the dinner table.

455
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:50,366
He used this hot poker
to remind me that he eats first.

456
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,827
I wondered how you'd gotten that.

457
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,667
There are times, even to this day,

458
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,837
where I'll lay awake in bed,

459
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,590
thinking about the fact that my father,

460
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:09,176
the man who was supposed
to protect us, to provide...

461
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,762
I'm no stranger to a man's cruelty.

462
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,477
Sometimes it's best
to leave the past where it is.

463
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,858
I should check on the children.

464
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,045
- You live here?
- Yes.

465
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,213
- It's a whorehouse.
- Yeah.

466
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,555
You want a drink?

467
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,058
Bourbon.

468
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,436
Two bourbons, the real stuff.

469
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,412
- You got a straw back there?
- A straw?

470
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,915
The second drawer down. Down.

471
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,588
To the lost.

472
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,306
Again?

473
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:38,766
Mmm.

474
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,063
You have a gun under your jacket.

475
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,941
It's a Colt 1903.

476
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:51,278
I have one of those

477
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,366
and a Smith & Wesson Triple Lock.

478
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,286
A Roth-Steyr,

479
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,498
a Webley.455,

480
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,043
a Mauser 1914,

481
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,713
very small.

482
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,883
Enfield 1917,

483
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:17,888
.30-06, telescopic sight. Very accurate.

484
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,766
Accurate to 700 yards.

485
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,525
But I like the Colt in the hand.

486
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,987
How do you use yours?

487
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,490
How do you think?

488
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,953
You use it to kill people.

489
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,000
It's very good for that.

490
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,674
I want to introduce you to someone. Odette!

491
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,927
Odette.

492
00:34:58,597 --> 00:34:59,638
Hi.

493
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,058
This is Richard Harrow.

494
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,352
He's a friend of mine. He's a war hero.

495
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:09,148
He needs to know how grateful the nation is
for his sacrifice.

496
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,442
You're a patriot, right?

497
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,740
I'm whatever you want me to be.

498
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,414
I'll watch your things.

499
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,666
I'll watch them. It's okay.

500
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,668
Come on, baby.

501
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,463
I got a whole ticker-tape parade ready.

502
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,187
I'm sorry, Harry.
I'm not following you.

503
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,731
International reply coupons.

504
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,235
This Italian fella up in Boston
buys 'em in bulk,

505
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,947
then sells 'em here at face value,
locking in his profit.

506
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,157
Well, if it's so easy,
why doesn't everyone do it?

507
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:05,663
All I know is he pays
50% on your investment within 45 days.

508
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:10,584
I just re-upped third time in a row.
The whole nest egg.

509
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:11,877
I'll let you know.

510
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,774
Mr. White, say hello to Harry Price.

511
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,818
Get a load of that.

512
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,653
Chalky White, the proprietor.

513
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,405
Quite a place.

514
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,199
You people certainly are a lively bunch.

515
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,913
So...

516
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,374
I met your boy.

517
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,709
I'm sure you heard by now.

518
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,086
- What?
- Mr. Lewis,

519
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,131
that little kid you sent round
with the bankroll to test me out.

520
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,091
I don't know what you're talking about.

521
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,135
That's how it's gonna be, huh?

522
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,269
Y'all have a good time.

523
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,480
Where the hell are our dates already?

524
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,317
Garcon, more giggle juice.

525
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,152
Right away, sir.

526
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,159
And what were you boys gabbing about?

527
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,535
Business, what else?

528
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,995
What else is there?

529
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,581
- Politics.
- His two favorite topics.

530
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,250
- His only two.
- That's not true.

531
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,210
I'll talk baseball anytime.

532
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,339
Baseball fan, eh?
I once owned a catcher's mitt

533
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,592
signed by Hardy Richardson.
My prized possession.

534
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,429
Come on, y'all. Get up off of your seats.

535
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:47,765
Harry, let's dance.

536
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,975
I'm beat, doll. Let's sit awhile.

537
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,352
You can sit later.

538
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,021
You can even lie down if you want.

539
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,400
Well, I'll certainly take you up on that offer.

540
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,743
Quite a couple.

541
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,204
A bit of a mismatch, you ask me.

542
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,247
She seems to like him.

543
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:14,458
She seemed to like the last one, too.

544
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,547
So you played baseball as a boy.

545
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,383
Do you still have your mitt?

546
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,343
What?

547
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,637
No. It was stolen.

548
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:30,224
That's too bad. What happened?

549
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,935
Nothing. I don't know.

550
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,437
A bunch of kids robbed it, beat me up.

551
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,064
My goodness.

552
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:38,732
Were you hurt?

553
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,570
I don't want to talk about it.

554
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:58,669
Is it ready yet?

555
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,673
Commodore, you barely ate nothin'.

556
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,134
My stomach's on fire.

557
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,594
Jerry.

558
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,097
Come here, God damn it.

559
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,226
That ain't no proper food for a dog.

560
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,441
Louanne, what the hell
are you doing out there?

561
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,109
Just a minute now.

562
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,987
Been near three months, Commodore,

563
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,865
and Dr. Surran said that maybe...

564
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,992
Hey, I told you no doctors, damn it.

565
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:31,952
Maybe you got worms.

566
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,954
Worms, my ass.

567
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,207
- I'm dying.
- Now, now, hush up with that.

568
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,419
Nucky Thompson come by?

569
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,964
No sir, but he sent Mr. Boyd
on by with your envelope.

570
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,800
He's getting too big for his britches.

571
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,719
Mr. Boyd, sir?

572
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,804
Thompson, God damn it!

573
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,308
Sends one of his fat-assed minions.

574
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,936
I put the son of a bitch where he is,

575
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,521
and they put me in jail.

576
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,483
I left the envelope on your desk, Commodore.

577
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,486
Oh, man!

578
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,410
Jesus Christ! That's awful.

579
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,329
You just lay down now.

580
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,748
And I'll make my porridge paste

581
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,751
with the tea leaves and rub it on your belly.

582
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,767
"In these days of indigestion
It is oftentimes a question

583
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,144
"As of what to eat and what to leave alone

584
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,438
"Every microbe and bacillus

585
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,981
"Has a different way to kill us

586
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,526
"And in time will claim us for their own

587
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,653
"There are germs of every kind

588
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,154
"In every food that you will find

589
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,031
"In the market or upon the bill of fare

590
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,243
"Drinking water's just as risky

591
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,994
"As the so-called deadly whiskey

592
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,540
"And it's often a mistake to breathe the air"

593
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,584
Bravo!

594
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,379
Hooray!

595
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,632
More coffee?

596
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,384
No, thank you.

597
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,719
- Can I be excused?
- You may.

598
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,180
- Me too, please.
- Off you go.

599
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,741
I've been feeling regretful
about something I said.

600
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,452
I'm afraid I took some bad advice.

601
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,079
Oh?

602
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,166
In your house, your father's house,

603
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,752
you began to tell me of your troubles

604
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,337
and I was

605
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,464
quite selfish.

606
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,466
It's all right.

607
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,801
It's not.

608
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,762
I want you to confide in me,

609
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,931
to feel safe in doing so.

610
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,519
We're obviously intimate

611
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,438
in many ways,

612
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,902
but I'd like you to feel that you can talk to me.

613
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,950
The baseball mitt.

614
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,412
Some kids stole it,
so my father marched me down

615
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,331
and made me challenge them to a fight.

616
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,627
There were four of them, years older than me.

617
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,798
I got beaten unconscious
and was in the hospital for 11 days.

618
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,467
That's horrible.

619
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,137
Life can be that way.

620
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,150
Hello.

621
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,652
Who's on the telephone?

622
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,820
- A friend of Mr. Thompson's.
- Of course.

623
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,906
- Be quiet.
- Come get me and we'll drive over.

624
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:59,952
And give Fleming a call.
I'm sure he'd like to see it.

625
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,458
My father's house, it's all done.

626
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,377
Would you care to have a look?

627
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,212
I'd love to,

628
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,714
but I need to put Emily down for her nap.

629
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,634
- Can I come?
- Mr. Thompson's busy, dear.

630
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,678
Uncle Nucky.

631
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,472
Get your coat, kiddo.

632
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,006
Remember me?

633
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,632
Keep your hands on the table.

634
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,103
The whore, Pearl.

635
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,440
I was just doing Sheridan's bidding.

636
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,233
Relax, I'm not gonna kill you.

637
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,071
Did you serve, Liam?

638
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,282
In the war?

639
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:21,867
I had rheumatic fever.

640
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,535
Three years.

641
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,704
France mostly.

642
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,378
It's almost impossible to describe the horror.

643
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,256
It's a living,

644
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,217
waking

645
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,636
nightmare.

646
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,015
There was a soldier, a German.

647
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:49,644
Him and his men tried to attack our position
in the Argonne Forest.

648
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,689
It was nighttime.

649
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:56,234
And while he was trying
to climb through some barbed wire,

650
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,694
I shot him twice.

651
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:59,696
Once in the stomach, once in the neck.

652
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,532
He slumped over the barbed wire.

653
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:06,411
And no matter what he did
to try and wriggle free,

654
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,914
it just got worse for him.

655
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:13,502
I left him there like that for days,

656
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,671
listening to him moaning, crying.

657
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,969
That's German for "Mama, mama!"

658
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,305
That's what he kept saying.

659
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,391
The curious thing

660
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:33,480
is that despite the fact
that his situation was utterly hopeless,

661
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:35,982
he didn't want to die.

662
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,402
I offered to kill him several times,

663
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,487
but he just kept fighting.

664
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,325
Like some miracle would befall him

665
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,828
and get him out of his predicament.

666
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:50,872
We hold on so desperately to life.

667
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,874
Some people feel,

668
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,252
certainly in that soldier's situation,

669
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,212
that being alive is...

670
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,714
Is much, much worse.

671
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:07,556
I'm gonna go now.
I don't want to ever see you again.

672
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,057
You won't.

673
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:10,851
May I offer you a glass of water, sir?

674
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,731
You're very welcome.

675
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,697
Ladies, how are you doing?

676
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,890
Oh, jeez!

677
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,580
Pretty amazing, huh, Pop?

678
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,710
Can you believe it's the same place?

679
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,044
What's he doing here?

680
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,338
I wanted him to see it all fixed up.

681
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,007
Well, he's seen it. Now get out.

682
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,561
You may think you're king,

683
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,105
but you're not worth a goddamn.

684
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,528
Yeah, get me out of here.

685
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,520
Go wait in the car.

686
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,804
Jesus Christ! Did you call the department?

687
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,148
Find a better place to live.

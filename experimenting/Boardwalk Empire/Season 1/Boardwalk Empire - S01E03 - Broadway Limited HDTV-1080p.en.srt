1
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,270
- Keep him steady.
- Watch the corner.

2
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,605
I got it.

3
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,486
Watch the door.

4
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,544
How is he still alive
after three days out in the cold?

5
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,505
He's fat.

6
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,839
The fuck's that supposed to mean?

7
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,842
He's insulated. I don't know.
How should I know?

8
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,135
The cold and the buckshot.

9
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,095
I'm not a doctor.

10
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,388
Really?

11
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,183
I thought we killed them all.

12
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,977
He thought. Fucking Aristotle.

13
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,188
So what are they doing to him?

14
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,481
What difference does it make?

15
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,943
Guy's got a hole in his belly
big as a grapefruit.

16
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,569
He thaws out a little, he's a goner.

17
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,321
So now you're a doctor.

18
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,572
What are you mad at me for?

19
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,907
I'm late.

20
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,369
Let nature take its course.
Help it along if you can.

21
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,996
And you better hope he dies real soon.

22
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,951
Quick now, close them doors.

23
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,744
About time.

24
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,414
Yeah, this nag isn't exactly Man o' War.

25
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,916
You didn't happen to run at Saratoga
last summer, did you?

26
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,793
Let's go. Open it up.

27
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,551
I'm a do a bottle count as soon as we done.

28
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,052
And for every drop goes missing,

29
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,555
I'm a take a drop of blood
out of one of y'all asses.

30
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,056
Simon Legree.

31
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,225
I don't give a fuck they agree or not.

32
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,562
So what do you think, Chalky?

33
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,148
I can mix this up real nice.

34
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,775
Five hundred bottles will get you 3,000.

35
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,488
So how're we working the split?

36
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,825
Assuming this batch goes well,
80/20 my favor.

37
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,578
I supply the product,
you and your people work your magic.

38
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,582
That's a whole lot of magic for only 20%.

39
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,334
It's the same deal I gave Mickey Cusick.

40
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,589
Did you know that motherfucker
changed his name to Doyle?

41
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,174
I did.

42
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,217
40%.

43
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,512
- What happened to 30%?
- I charged you 10% extra

44
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,139
for thinking I'd take the same deal as Mickey.

45
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,766
I didn't realize you were so sensitive.

46
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,935
As a baby's ass, motherfucker.

47
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,022
Let's call it 35%.

48
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,150
We in business.

49
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,530
Come on now, hurry up.

50
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,076
What's "motherfucker" mean?

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,370
I suppose it's a schvartze word.

52
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,042
You want two of them right now?
Let me get that.

53
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,884
Why aren't you eating?

54
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,052
I'm not hungry.

55
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,471
You need your strength back.

56
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,890
I'm stronger than I look, Edith.

57
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,851
I suppose you'd have to be,
after what you put up with.

58
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,231
I'm considering taking in a boarder.

59
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,733
What? Some burlesque performer?

60
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,405
Come stay with me if you like.

61
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,408
Thank you. We couldn't.

62
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,162
What about your own people?

63
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,581
Have you thought about going home?

64
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,794
I came to this country for a better life.

65
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,256
When the baby coming, Mama?

66
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,593
I don't know, dear.

67
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,513
The stork must have gotten lost.

68
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,599
Eat your egg.

69
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,980
I'm gonna make you a brisket,

70
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,107
some potatoes on the side.

71
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,942
That'd be lovely.

72
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,038
- Mrs. Schroeder?
- Who are you?

73
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,831
I'm Mrs. Schroeder.

74
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,501
A job for you from Mr. Thompson.

75
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,797
My deepest condolences
on account of your husband.

76
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,723
"Belle Femme. The Ritz-Carlton."

77
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,142
Sounds fancy. What is it?

78
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,644
A shop, I suppose.

79
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,688
It's French.

80
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,984
And how do you know a man
like Nucky Thompson?

81
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,028
Through a friend.

82
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,864
The Temperance League.

83
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,077
I'll need you to look after the children.

84
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,163
Those French, I've read about them.

85
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,545
All right. You all set?

86
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,672
That wound needs attention.

87
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,299
Later. I need to question him.

88
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,343
This man is gravely ill.

89
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,553
He has a massive internal infection.

90
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,722
I'll just be a few minutes.

91
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,739
What did he do, Officer?

92
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,825
Go to sleep.

93
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,233
What's that?

94
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,359
Come on.

95
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,156
What did you say?

96
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,537
What's going on over there?

97
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,708
So what do you know about
Saturday night's events?

98
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,419
Is he all right?

99
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,340
You don't say.

100
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,092
How many men?

101
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:38,184
You can't go in there.

102
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,448
Poor bastard.

103
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,456
Sir?

104
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,000
Sir, can you hear me?

105
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,502
He needs his rest. He has a massive infection.

106
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,962
And I need to speak with him.

107
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,714
No interviews. This witness is in my custody.

108
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,759
We're over the Pennsylvania border,
which makes the locus federal.

109
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,261
Says you with all your fancy talk.

110
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,306
Go on now. Shoo.

111
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,600
You're obstructing
a federal investigation, Sheriff.

112
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,435
Yeah? So get a warrant.

113
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,443
Stay here and guard this witness.

114
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,232
Almost there. Hold still.

115
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,653
Jesus, if I knew this was the cure,

116
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,488
I'd have taken my chances fighting the Huns.

117
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,282
You should've thought of that
before intentionally

118
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,534
exposing yourself to gonorrhea, Mr. Luciano.

119
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,207
The good news is

120
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,379
the zinc sulfate treatments have worked.

121
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,965
Your symptoms have abated?

122
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,174
Yeah.

123
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,137
The faucet stopped dripping,
if that's what you mean.

124
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,848
And urination, any burning, itching?

125
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,435
Nothing I can't take. It's just...

126
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:46,937
What?

127
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,401
Sometimes, I...

128
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,904
I don't know.

129
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,076
It's like when I'm doing it,

130
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,245
or trying to do it

131
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,581
with a broad.

132
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:06,915
Yes?

133
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,920
It starts out fine,

134
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,465
and then it goes away.

135
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,383
Your penis becomes flaccid?

136
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:17,843
Come again?

137
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,762
It doesn't stay hard.

138
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,141
Sometimes, yeah.

139
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,893
- Ah. Uh-huh.
- Oh!

140
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,520
What are you doing?
What, are you writing a book?

141
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,898
Mr. Luciano, I need to document
your recovery,

142
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,524
the course of treatment.

143
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,318
Forget it. I'm fine.

144
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,154
- Forget I said nothin'.
- But...

145
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,947
Look, you hear what I says or what?

146
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,783
Huh?

147
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,758
Sure, put me down for a grand.

148
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,637
Well, it's a wonderful cause.

149
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,183
Righty-o. I'm glad I could help.

150
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,020
Who you giving money to now?

151
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,355
Nobody.

152
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,734
- The premature baby hospital.
- On the Boardwalk?

153
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,945
Did I say I was finished?

154
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,370
That place gives me the willies.

155
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,834
You were so smart not to have children.

156
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,470
You know, Flo's in town.

157
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,140
- Who?
- Ziegfeld.

158
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,393
Eddie says he's casting
for the 9 O'clock Frolic.

159
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,854
- My Eddie?
- Eddie Cantor.

160
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:52,938
Oh.

161
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,232
I thought you were done with all that.

162
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,942
Do you want me to be?

163
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,361
Whatever makes you happy, kid.

164
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,614
You make me happy.

165
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,579
You know,

166
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,667
I'd have a baby if that's what you want.

167
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,129
- What?
- It'd ruin my figure,

168
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,256
but if that's what you want.

169
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,595
Don't you think I'd make a good mommy?

170
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,972
Sure you would. Swell.

171
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,808
You have a very loving disposition.

172
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:30,893
So?

173
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,980
This is a hotel. I'm not set up here for a baby.

174
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,942
We could get a house in Cape May.

175
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,986
Now's not a good time.

176
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,071
Let's revisit this after the election.

177
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,907
Okay.

178
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,499
Oops.

179
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,590
Mmm. That's delicious.

180
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,678
That looks delicious, too.

181
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,908
How'd you get him to sit so long?

182
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,034
What?

183
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,453
Oh, I don't know.

184
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,580
The photographer made him laugh.

185
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,251
He said he's one of the best-looking
children he's ever seen.

186
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,586
Yeah, that's how they get your money.

187
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,797
You don't think your son's handsome?

188
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,298
Sure he is.

189
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,510
I mean, with you for a mother.

190
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,555
Let's go find the other people.

191
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,146
Nobody's supposed to make way.

192
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,027
It's hard to believe he was ever this little.

193
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,030
Three years is a long time.

194
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,290
You don't like the vacuum sweeper?

195
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,834
It just makes such a racket.

196
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,211
- It's more efficient.
- It scares Tommy.

197
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,464
All in the name of progress.

198
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,678
You know they have a gun now
that shoots 600 bullets in a minute?

199
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,555
Lovely.

200
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,808
The Lewis Gun. I used one at Saint-Mihiel.

201
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,397
We used to talk about books.

202
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,989
You are too thin.

203
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,326
When did you last bathe?

204
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,703
Beg your pardon?

205
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,538
Do you bathe? When?

206
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,625
- Yes. Yesterday.
- Good.

207
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,252
You must bathe once a week at a minimum.

208
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,213
Your hair as well, and fingernails each day.

209
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,344
You will not dirty our garments
or cause them to stench.

210
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,388
You've worked before in a shop?

211
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,225
No, ma'am. I was a servant.

212
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,852
The last girl, Rosalie,

213
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,104
four years of experience.

214
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,566
- What became of her?
- Mr. Thompson.

215
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,903
She had to be, how to say,
jettison to give the job for you.

216
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,864
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

217
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,449
You're sorry?

218
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,120
What are to be my duties, Madame Jeunet?

219
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,997
You are a dresser.

220
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,626
You will assist the customers when they try
the garments on, n'est-ce pas?

221
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,046
Occasionally you will wear our merchandise

222
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,634
so the customer may visualize
what it looks like not from the mannequin.

223
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,803
You will be prompt

224
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,555
and you will work late when I require.

225
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,307
Parlez-vous français?

226
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,019
No, ma'am. Small phrases here and there.

227
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,105
Yet I speak your English.

228
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,358
- Yes.
- There you have it, no?

229
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,859
Daddy, look.

230
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,487
In every event, you are to be seen, not heard.

231
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,030
- Yes, ma'am.
- Seen.

232
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,532
You do not speak.

233
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,242
- Really?
- Yes.

234
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,327
Well, let me try it.

235
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,788
Change into this immédiatement.

236
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,167
I may look simple but I want you to know

237
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,170
I've been to college
I'm full of knowledge

238
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,174
I'm right at home with brainy men
And them my wisdom I show

239
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,218
But when there's clever girls around
I get up and go

240
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,138
Those educated babies are a bore

241
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,222
You said it.

242
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,726
I'm gonna say what I said many times before

243
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,313
The dumber they come
The better I like 'em

244
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,399
'Cause the dumb ones know how to make love

245
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,903
A wisenheimer has you meet her folks
when you call

246
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,238
Now the party can start.

247
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,740
The sheriff's here.

248
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,366
Hide the hooch.

249
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,579
They look like angels sent from above

250
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,498
The clever girl will want to know...

251
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,291
So what happened? Is he gone?

252
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,210
I didn't get a chance. That Fed showed up.

253
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,544
What Fed?

254
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,505
What's-his-name, the prohi with the big head.

255
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,006
Van Alden?

256
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,716
He stationed his man outside the room.

257
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,635
So what are you doing here?

258
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,428
Halloran's there. Relax.

259
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,846
They're on death watch, I'm telling you.

260
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,390
Nuck, you're missing this.

261
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,059
That's Eddie Cantor, eh?

262
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,311
Jesus, Eli. This is serious.

263
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,523
Say, I'm not the one
who got us into this mess, right?

264
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:10,941
Save the insolence for Jimmy.

265
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,737
...have won beauty prizes
They look like angels sent from above

266
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,199
You start by squeezing clever girls
You're soon on the shelf

267
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,868
But when you're with Dumb Doras
You can just be yourself

268
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:25,205
That's why the dumber they come
The better I like 'em

269
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,375
'Cause the dumb ones know how to make love

270
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,018
Wake up.

271
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,022
This is a writ of certiorari
from the federal magistrate in Philadelphia

272
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,858
giving me custody and jurisdiction

273
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,443
over the patient known as John Doe.
Any questions?

274
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,696
I need to telephone somebody.

275
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,240
Telephone whoever you'd like.
Follow me, men.

276
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,453
You're making a big mistake.

277
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,375
Come on, push him in.

278
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,881
A writ of certiorari? Jesus Christ, boss.

279
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,424
Don't take the Lord's name in vain.

280
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,927
For Christ...
We just broke about a dozen laws.

281
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,679
Down here? What laws?

282
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,223
Here, gentlemen, buy yourselves a hot meal.

283
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,976
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

284
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,439
What a tub of lard, huh?

285
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,066
- Where are we even going?
- New York.

286
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,235
He's one of Rothstein's men.

287
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,248
Lift your cup up a little higher.

288
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,798
I got you. I got you.

289
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,675
Whoa!

290
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,844
Where're you going, pal?

291
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,642
Tommy. Tommy.

292
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,856
- What? You wanna go inside?
- Yeah.

293
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,444
Tommy, my lad!

294
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,658
- I'm sorry, you're...
- Oh.

295
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,826
There you go.

296
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,454
Robert Dittrich. A pleasure.

297
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,247
You must be Jimmy.

298
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,708
I'm Mary, Robert's wife.

299
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,543
Jim Darmody.

300
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,381
He's such a little love, and photogenic.

301
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,466
We are quite fond of him.

302
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,218
Your wife, too.

303
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,553
We're not married actually, but...

304
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,180
Oh. Yes.

305
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:48,974
Oh, my apologies.

306
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:52,143
No, we're going to be. We're engaged.

307
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,354
Oh. Well, congratulations.

308
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,732
I was away

309
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,026
in the war.

310
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,362
Yes, yes, yes. France, was it?

311
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,366
The news accounts,
the battles at Ypres in particular,

312
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,243
some thrilling tales.

313
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,329
I would not have minded
having my mettle tested like that.

314
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,750
- We hear Paris is lovely.
- Ah, the Louvre.

315
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,671
Didn't have a lot of time to take in the sights.

316
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,340
Would you care for some tea?

317
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,551
No, we really should be going. Come on, pal.

318
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,094
No. No.

319
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,304
Come on. Let's go.

320
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,098
- It's lunchtime.
- No.

321
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,225
Tommy, come on. Mama's waiting.

322
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,603
- Be a good boy.
- Here.

323
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,188
We'll visit another time, okay?

324
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,733
I got to do it now.

325
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,067
Our best to Angela.

326
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,948
Check his wrist.

327
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,287
- It's faint.
- It's 12:15. We can make Bellevue by 5:00.

328
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,998
- We're gonna lose him, sir.
- Don't you let him die. Get back there.

329
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,167
- And do what?
- Slap him. Wake him up.

330
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,796
Who shot you?

331
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,759
We have to find a doctor.

332
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,560
Open.

333
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,812
Wider, please.

334
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,939
Mind Dr. Lissenger.

335
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,067
You eat peanut brittle, this is what happens.

336
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,861
- What's the meaning of this?
- This man needs a doctor.

337
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,197
- I'm a federal agent.
- I'm a dentist.

338
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,324
- Out of the chair, kid, now!
- Okay.

339
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,827
Now you got something to, you know,

340
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,497
boost his system, give him some pep?

341
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:40,126
- This man is dying. He needs a surgeon.
- You keep him alive. I need to speak with him!

342
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,755
Cocaine. It's an anesthetic.

343
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,510
I only know how to put it in one place.

344
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,812
What's taking so long?

345
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,063
He needs a larger dose.

346
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,107
What are you waiting for?

347
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,872
All right, who shot you? What'd he look like?

348
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,888
- What language is that?
- It's gutter German.

349
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:35,807
Yiddish.

350
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,975
What'd he say?

351
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,935
- I can't.
- Mrs. Fishbaum.

352
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,437
Word for word.
This is a federal investigation.

353
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,733
He said you should fuck your grandmother

354
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,070
with your faggot penis.

355
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,573
Little faggot penis.

356
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,965
You want to die here or at home?

357
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,803
Tell me who it was.

358
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,182
Good God, man!

359
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,189
Come on.

360
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,778
There were two.

361
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,783
Young. One thin.

362
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,703
Did they talk, say anything?

363
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,172
One,

364
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,467
Jimmy.

365
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:54,844
Fair-haired?

366
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,977
Masks. Masks.

367
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,447
"And the angel said,

368
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,866
"'lf any man worship the beast,

369
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,078
"'he shall drink of the wine
of the wrath of God

370
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,955
"'and he shall be tormented with fire

371
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,164
"'in the presence of the lamb."'

372
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,582
Isn't he Jewish?

373
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:28,753
"'And the smoke of their torment
ascendeth up forever and ever,

374
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,715
"'and they shall have no rest day nor night,

375
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,885
"'they who worship the beast."'

376
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,187
He's all yours.

377
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,199
Okay, gents.

378
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,951
Two thousand.

379
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,036
Hand like a foot.

380
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,663
That's it for me.

381
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,383
I'll see your two

382
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,553
and raise you two.

383
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,188
What should I do here, Charlie?

384
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,406
Depends on what the other guy got.

385
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,702
- Depends on what the other gentleman has.
- Right.

386
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,580
Well? What does he have?

387
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,874
How should I know? I'm no swami.

388
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,086
The very reason this game is so challenging.

389
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,965
There's a lot of money in that pot.

390
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,467
How much do you think is in there?

391
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,801
Plenty.

392
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,345
$22,500.

393
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,013
That's right.

394
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,015
How much mining equipment
do you have to sell

395
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,516
to make 22 grand, Buck?

396
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,768
A lot.

397
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,562
Now are you gonna call or fold?

398
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,610
I'll see your two,

399
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,946
raise you five.

400
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,209
Take it. I was bluffing.

401
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,794
I know.

402
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,128
So was I.

403
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,382
- God damn it!
- What say we take a break?

404
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,134
Only 14 hours and you're tired already?

405
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,012
Unfortunate.

406
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,972
Son of a gun.

407
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,686
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

408
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,315
Turns out my sister-in-law's nephew,

409
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,234
for a time at least,

410
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,528
survived the shooting in the woods.

411
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,032
I'm sorry about your loss.

412
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,994
Obviously, if there's anything I can do...

413
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,540
There is actually. You can kill someone for me

414
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,667
to settle a debt.

415
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:16,754
I have it on good authority
that a James Darmody of Atlantic City

416
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,132
was one of the two shooters.

417
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,716
Who was the other one?

418
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,260
I don't know.

419
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:26,180
But I'd bet you're persuasive enough
to get Darmody to tell you.

420
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,433
That's a good bet.

421
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,268
The only kind I make.

422
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,189
You are alone.

423
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,654
Lonely.

424
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,578
But there is a man.

425
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,705
Dark.

426
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,791
You know me. There's always a man.

427
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:56,878
This one, he's not like the others.
He's dangerous.

428
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,422
Mmm. Do tell.

429
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,761
I'm hearing my future.

430
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,433
I'm very busy, Gillian.

431
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,811
Give us a couple of minutes.

432
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,902
You could have come see me, you know.

433
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,446
Request an audience with the other peasants?

434
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,908
I didn't want to run into Jimmy.

435
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,203
What can I do for you?

436
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,747
You can honor the agreement that we made.

437
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,290
He's fine, Gillian.

438
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,791
He's not fine.

439
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,421
I'm his mother. He's a shell.

440
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,048
I don't know what you're talking about.

441
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,884
You promised
you would keep him out of trouble.

442
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,385
He's not in trouble.

443
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,889
Do you think I'm blind,
that I don't hear things?

444
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:54,060
He shows up out of nowhere
with some $1,000 necklace,

445
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,187
which he then steals back from me.

446
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,897
It's a rough patch, okay?

447
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,607
He just got back.

448
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:04,195
We take it for granted, but I'm sure
the entire war was very trying.

449
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,864
He should have stayed in college.

450
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,825
I advised him to. He wouldn't listen.

451
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,869
Leading a horse to water and all that.

452
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,497
He's a grown man
who wanted to serve his country.

453
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,040
Could I have forced him not to?

454
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:21,754
I was under the impression
that you could do anything.

455
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,631
I'm not God, Gillian.

456
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,136
Now you tell me.

457
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,949
Where the fuck is this place?

458
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,623
The dope was waiting outside.

459
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,792
'Cause youse didn't give me the right address.

460
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,003
- What, is it raining out?
- Raining?

461
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,505
I almost drowned, Leo.

462
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,175
He almost drowned.

463
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,436
Thanks for bailing me out.

464
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,605
I gotta protect my investment, huh?

465
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,524
We would've met you at the jail,
but we've been getting the lay of the land.

466
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,192
Fuck the land.

467
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,820
The Boardwalk's where the money's at.

468
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,866
- So where're you staying?
- Some flophouse on Baltic, off the beach.

469
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,744
Doc says the salt air helps his respiratory.

470
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,538
That, plus the 15 warrants
waiting back in Philly.

471
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,665
Ain't you got a lawyer, Pius?

472
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,250
I'm Pius, you stupid Polack.

473
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,793
- The name's Doyle now.
- So?

474
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,670
Go check on the car.

475
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,469
I'm Ignacious.

476
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,887
I thought that was Lucien.

477
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,472
No, Lucien got the birthmark.

478
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,223
You fucking garlic-eaters.

479
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,683
What is there, like 14 of youse?

480
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,102
Nine, not counting our sisters.

481
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,646
Our pop,

482
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,689
he loves our mother very much.

483
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,779
So, this Nucky Thompson,

484
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,114
gave our entire operation over to the coons.
You believe that?

485
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,616
Our operation?

486
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,660
I loaned you that dough with vigorish.

487
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,371
He gets took for a chump
and now we're partners all of a sudden?

488
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,456
I thought you guys were
looking for an opportunity.

489
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,749
We're looking for our money.

490
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,293
How can I pay youse
if they put me out of business?

491
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,587
That's your problem, ain't it?

492
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,661
We have a very important customer.

493
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,790
You will take these to her
in the dressing room.

494
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,668
Whatever she needs.

495
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,507
Hello?

496
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,429
Finally.

497
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,932
Are you gonna help me
get out of this thing or what?

498
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,316
You came to see Nucky.

499
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,985
Yes. I'm Margaret Schroeder.

500
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,820
Bully for you.

501
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,616
When we're done here,

502
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,535
drop my cloak off with your tailor.

503
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,164
Your boss is having the lining
repaired for me.

504
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,249
Yes, ma'am.

505
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,557
I don't go for cheap merchandise.

506
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:46,727
I'll try the step-in.

507
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,109
The step-in.

508
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,741
That one.

509
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,452
Jesus, sister.

510
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,870
I'm sorry.

511
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,749
You do work here, don't you?

512
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,125
I do.

513
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,544
So open it up.

514
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:35,985
Tie it.

515
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,417
Well?

516
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,086
What do you think?

517
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,131
It's very flattering.

518
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,635
You know, I heard Nucky on the phone
getting you this job.

519
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,221
It was very kind of him.

520
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,974
Yeah, well,

521
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,519
he's a soft touch for the charity cases.

522
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,490
Yes, I'll hold.

523
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,535
They're putting me through.

524
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,538
"The Elephant Hotel."

525
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,498
"Dear Lenore,

526
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,584
"Douglas had another attack of dropsy,

527
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,836
"so we came down for his benefit.

528
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,796
"The ocean is lovely."

529
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,340
I had an uncle once had dropsy.

530
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,926
You're reading someone's
private correspondence.

531
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,638
Go ahead, please.

532
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,890
Yes, Supervisor. Van Alden here.

533
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,850
Nelson, where are you?

534
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,936
The post office, Atlantic City.

535
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,020
The post office?

536
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,773
It's the only federal building in town.

537
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,358
We lost him, sir.

538
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,360
Damn it. Did he talk?

539
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,862
That's the reason I'm calling.

540
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,322
Sir, I have reason to believe

541
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,991
James Darmody was involved
in the woods massacre.

542
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,785
Darmody. Why do I know that name?

543
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,412
He's Thompson's lackey, sir.
We tried to recruit him.

544
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,914
Right. Yes.

545
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,667
Given as how the local sheriff
is Thompson's brother,

546
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,127
the level of cooperation
I'm likely to receive here

547
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,089
necessitates my handling this arrest myself.

548
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,173
What arrest?

549
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,967
Darmody, sir. For murder.

550
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,260
Easy, laddy-buck. You sit tight

551
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,888
till I speak with Bodine
in the US Attorney's office.

552
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,640
When will that be, sir?

553
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,433
Get some rest. Go home and see Rose.

554
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,893
I'll call you in a few days.

555
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,144
I'll be right here, sir.

556
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:37,439
Go home, Nelson. Visit your wife.
That's an order.

557
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,526
And good job.

558
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:51,870
Jimmy.

559
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,581
Close the door.

560
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:01,922
Have a seat.

561
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,472
Your pal from the woods,

562
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,598
he's dead.

563
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,267
Good.

564
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,893
That'll keep him quiet.

565
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,771
He already talked.
He fingered you to the Feds.

566
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,149
That's impossible.

567
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,027
How would he even know who I was?

568
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,653
The other one,

569
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:25,946
Carbone.

570
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,948
Did he call you by name?

571
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,835
When you were 10 years old, 11 maybe,

572
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,590
I don't know if you'll even remember this,

573
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,510
President Taft came to town,
some campaign speech.

574
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,221
You were in the crowd.

575
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,140
I suppose you were with your dad.

576
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,809
But you turned to me and said,

577
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,438
"Nuck, what's a fella gotta do
to become president?"

578
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,733
I said, "Well, you gotta study,

579
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,445
"learn everything you can about the world

580
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,781
"and do a lot of hard work."

581
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,202
And you looked up at me in disbelief
and said,

582
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:14,953
"Gee, is that all?"

583
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,171
I used to think you'd own the world one day.

584
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,423
You were like that kid

585
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,051
in the Alger story, Raggy Dick.

586
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,889
You did everything right.

587
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,682
And then...

588
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,191
Nuck.

589
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,528
Nuck, I'll do whatever you want.

590
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,071
What you'll do is leave.

591
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,864
Leave Atlantic City?

592
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,449
You're through here, kid.

593
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,284
Where am I supposed to go?

594
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,954
I hear California's nice.
Maybe Chaplin needs a foil.

595
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,580
I've got a kid to feed, Eli.

596
00:40:58,665 --> 00:40:59,957
And I got eight,

597
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,209
which is why I think
before I go off half-cocked.

598
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,044
What, you're gonna lecture me now?

599
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:07,131
If it was up to me,
it wouldn't stop with a lecture.

600
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,558
Take this money,

601
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,144
give it to your wife.

602
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,858
I want you to know, Nuck,

603
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,193
I never meant to hurt you.

604
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,321
What are you gonna do, cry, big war hero?

605
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,790
Good luck, James.

606
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,641
I wonder sometimes, if it was me,

607
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,769
would you be half as understanding?

608
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,698
I have a right to know where you're going.

609
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,658
I told you, I can't talk about it, okay?

610
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:20,287
No, it's not okay.
You're a grown man with a child.

611
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,623
Am I?

612
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,333
What?

613
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,627
Why are you fighting?

614
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,045
We're not fighting, sweetie.

615
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,255
Tommy, buddy, go play inside.

616
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,344
So that's it? You're just leaving?

617
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,429
You seemed to be okay with it last time.

618
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,972
What are you talking about?

619
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,974
What am I talking about?

620
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,818
- What?
- What?

621
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,697
Your shoulders are bare,
that look on your face.

622
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:57,866
I thought you'd like it.

623
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,409
I would have.

624
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:02,079
Plenty of fellas at the front
had pictures of their sweethearts.

625
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,331
How would I have known where to send it?

626
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,583
Hmm?

627
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,670
Not a letter in almost two years, Jimmy.

628
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,921
I thought you were dead.

629
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,423
The baby yesterday,
we went down to the Boardwalk.

630
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,425
He's awfully friendly with that photographer.

631
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,511
He's three years old.
He's friendly with everyone.

632
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,764
Did you fuck him while I was gone?

633
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,015
Jimmy.

634
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,936
'Cause I will go back there
and I will fucking kill him.

635
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,646
What's wrong with you?

636
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,357
This man, his wife, they're lovely people.

637
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,527
They befriended me and your son
when we had no one.

638
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,362
There was my mother.

639
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,329
You don't know what it was like being alone,

640
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,040
not knowing whether you were dead or alive.

641
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:51,628
Just as I get used to living without you,
you show up out of nowhere.

642
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,631
What did you expect?

643
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:56,216
I don't know!

644
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,886
For things to be normal?

645
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:11,064
Things were barely normal
before you left, Jimmy.

646
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:17,237
We hardly even knew each other.

647
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,077
Well, you know me a lot better now.

648
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,009
- Make sure them labels are on straight.
- That's right.

649
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,261
No glue running off the sides.

650
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,769
Bring the Packard around.

651
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,399
Let me get one of them.

652
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,872
The roast tastes good.

653
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,323
This boy's not 20 years old.

654
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,705
It's a tragedy, Chalky.

655
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,001
Is that what it is?

656
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:40,213
This goes no further than here,
you understand me?

657
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,883
You talk to these people.

658
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,929
It's an election year, Chalky.

659
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,223
The last thing we need is a race war.

660
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,062
Do you understand me?

661
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:02,402
For the time being.

662
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,157
What happened is

663
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,076
this man was cheating
with another fella's wife

664
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,037
and the fella shot him.

665
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,665
That's what it looks like to me.

666
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,549
50%.

667
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,675
Broadway Limited
going to Chicago, Illinois.

668
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,429
Broadway Limited going to Chicago, Illinois.

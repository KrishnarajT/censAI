1
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,267
"To Carthage then I came,

2
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,855
"where a cauldron of unholy loves sang all about mine ears."

3
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:51,152
Those are the words of Saint Augustine written 1,500 years ago.

4
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:56,032
His road to the Lord was an arduous one filled with many setbacks.

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,534
In Carthage, Carthage by the sea,

6
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,662
he found a city devoted to appetite,

7
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,752
to pleasure, to the temptations that keep us from our better selves.

8
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,547
And in that place he did succumb to what was offered.

9
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,802
He did succumb.

10
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,056
Gentlemen, Atlantic City

11
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,309
is the grandchild of that vanished metropolis.

12
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,562
Should you aspire to replace me here,

13
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,483
and should Supervisor Elliot accept you,

14
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:35,112
you will be bribed, coerced and tempted on a daily basis.

15
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,448
Bring on the dancing girls.

16
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:48,751
My partner, Agent Eric Sebso, died in the line of duty of a heart attack.

17
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,258
I will not have his memory sullied with infantile humor.

18
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,062
The supervisor will review your applications.

19
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,789
Nelson, I wish you'd reconsider.

20
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,835
There's nothing here for me, sir.

21
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,052
- Did you see this?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,933
Buy them drinks, promise them jobs.

23
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,060
Do whatever you need to do to get your people to vote.

24
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,397
And once they do, send them over to my ward and have them vote again.

25
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,816
I still say replacing Eli was a mistake.

26
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,652
What "still"? You never said a word about it.

27
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,449
I want a big turnout Tuesday, men and women alike.

28
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,576
Hell, Nuck, you'll even get spooks.

29
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,536
- What the fuck you just say?
- What?

30
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:09,415
I got my clerk combing the obituaries. He's writing down names.

31
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,877
Yet another Atlantic City politician elected by dead people.

32
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,921
It's Halloween, Ed. Get in the spirit.

33
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,131
Talk about your absentee ballots.

34
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:22,845
I hope you're half as amusing during your concession speech.

35
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,403
We need to talk.

36
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,991
Hey, come on.

37
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:52,500
- Let's go for a walk, guys.
- Let's go blow the stink off ourselves.

38
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,920
I've been approached by the other side.

39
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,130
Really?

40
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,841
Fletcher and them other Democrats,

41
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,469
they paint a nice, pretty picture how it's gonna be

42
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,597
if I throw my weight behind them come election day.

43
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,225
And savvy businessman Chalky White believes them.

44
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,895
Savvy businessman Chalky White tell 'em he believe 'em,

45
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,481
then he pocket their money.

46
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,694
I take it that means you're sticking with me?

47
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,863
Some recognition for my loyalty would be nice.

48
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,123
You realize you put the bite on me every election?

49
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,584
Except this time you could actually lose.

50
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,713
What'd you have in mind?

51
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,089
Oh.

52
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,551
Ten grand, a new car.

53
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,764
And an invitation to that victory party down at Babette's.

54
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,271
That last part's a tall order, Chalky.

55
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,401
So is delivering 100% of that colored vote.

56
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:08,284
"Upon that night, when fairies light beneath the moon's pale beams,

57
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:13,497
"there, up the cove, they stray and rove and haunt the Halloween."

58
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,624
Boo!

59
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,627
More, Mama.

60
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,048
That's all for now. I need to finish the cake.

61
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,760
You go and wash your hands, please. And you help your sister.

62
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,054
The poem, was that Frost?

63
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,305
Robert Burns.

64
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,349
My nana would read it each year on All Hallows Eve.

65
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,977
Will they recite it tonight in the churchyard?

66
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,981
That's more of a religious service to pray for the souls of the dead.

67
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,568
You Catholics certainly have a flair for the dramatic.

68
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,197
That we do.

69
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,450
Warren loves poetry.

70
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,583
Have you thought about where you'll go after Tuesday?

71
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,087
I hate to put you out, but I'm sure Warren will send for us

72
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,005
as soon as he wins the election.

73
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,050
I'm considering Margate.

74
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,929
I could get work in one of the shops.

75
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:14,475
Or perhaps I'll be rich. We'll see what the brack says.

76
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,062
The cake. It's called Barmbrack.

77
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,564
The Irish eat it on Halloween.

78
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:24,401
You bake a sixpence, a ring and a small piece of rag inside.

79
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,987
If you get the money, you'll be rich.

80
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,949
The ring, of course, means you'll be married.

81
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,036
And if you get the rag, well, you'll be destitute.

82
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,832
President Warren Harding.

83
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,130
You'll come visit, of course, to the White House.

84
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,970
And with the arsenic being introduced slowly through food,

85
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,305
the victim is often unaware of being poisoned at all.

86
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,891
He'd been complaining about his stomach since Christmas.

87
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,435
It would have to have been going on for some time.

88
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,397
There were toxic levels in his stew, in his tea biscuits.

89
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:04,483
Even his toothpaste was tainted.

90
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,277
How do you explain this, Mrs. Pratt?

91
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,574
Must have fell in there somehow on accident.

92
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,826
Yet your food was uncontaminated.

93
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,245
She killed Jerry, for God's sake.

94
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,956
I ate one of those cookies, you know.

95
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,626
- Who's Jerry?
- His dog.

96
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,503
He used to feed him his leftovers.

97
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,839
Treat that dog better than me.

98
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,427
Best goddamned friend I had, I can tell you that much.

99
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,888
You goddamn ignorant bitch.

100
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,681
After all I did for you.

101
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,892
- Calm down, dear.
- The hell I will.

102
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,435
She's a fucking murderer!

103
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,191
Why did you do this?

104
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,443
Poison him?

105
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,906
'Cause

106
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,951
if I used a shotgun,

107
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,582
I'd have had to clean the mess up myself.

108
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,420
I had all I could take of his abuse.

109
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,550
Are you gonna arrest her or not, Sheriff?

110
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,969
No.

111
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,638
He's not.

112
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,389
What?

113
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,225
Come with me.

114
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:34,156
I certainly understand why you'd want to, but you can't go around poisoning people.

115
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,661
- What the hell's going on?
- Just let him handle it, dear.

116
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,000
Take this and go far away.

117
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,544
Change your name and don't come back.

118
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,256
God bless you, sir.

119
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,675
- Bless you.
- Simmer yourself down.

120
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,010
And you be careful.

121
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,263
It's not worth giving yourself a fit.

122
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,847
You take this.

123
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,983
- What the hell are you doing, Nucky?
- Relax.

124
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,610
She tried to kill me, God damn it.

125
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,914
I've booked passage for myself and Carolyn.

126
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:28,961
Should I be indicted personally, and my attorney assures me that's imminent,

127
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,713
he'll let you know how to get in touch.

128
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,133
- Scotland in November?
- I hear the golfing is terrific.

129
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,302
- In June maybe.
- Trick or treat!

130
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,638
I'll tour the distilleries, take up the bagpipes perhaps.

131
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,765
There are any number of ways to occupy myself

132
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,768
until this baseball business goes away.

133
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,980
If you're indicted, it don't sound like it will.

134
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,899
Ain't there anybody in Chicago whose palm you can grease?

135
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,277
It's the World Series, Charlie.

136
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,323
- I'm a pariah, haven't you heard?
- So use a buffer.

137
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,325
There's Johnny Torrio.

138
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,536
He's new out there, doesn't have the political connections.

139
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,747
Nucky Thompson does.

140
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,165
And Torrio can connect you to him.

141
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,335
Thompson's not exactly a pal these days, is he?

142
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,588
This war we're in,

143
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,801
Charlie and I were talking, there's no percentage in it.

144
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,762
I mean, I know I brung them in,

145
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,097
but these greaseballs, these D'Alessio brothers...

146
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,599
Not your best suggestion.

147
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,393
You're a businessman, right?

148
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,020
Maybe you cut your losses.

149
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,439
I didn't realize I was paying you boys for advice.

150
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,608
The advice is free.

151
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,195
You pay us 'cause we'll get our hands dirty.

152
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,345
Hey.

153
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,556
What are you supposed to be? Huh?

154
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,023
Hey, Tommy, I asked you a question.

155
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,775
- Pirate.
- Pirate?

156
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,073
Hey, why don't you go put your shoes on and get ready for that party?

157
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,630
You gonna be home for dinner tonight?

158
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,554
- How long are you gonna keep on doing this?
- Doing what?

159
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:49,268
The silences, the cold shoulder, the distrustful looks.

160
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,688
If I was a different sort of man, it would be worse than looks.

161
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,399
For God's sake, Jimmy, do you want us to leave?

162
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,484
What do you mean "us"?

163
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,529
He's my son, too, Angela.

164
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,367
- And what's wrong with him?
- Nothing's wrong with him.

165
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,661
He's disrespectful.

166
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,621
He's terrified of you.

167
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,710
We both are.

168
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,629
What are you talking about?

169
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,717
You did it again last night.

170
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,305
You were screaming in your sleep.

171
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,643
- What?
- You grabbed me.

172
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,021
You were shaking me,

173
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,940
yelling something in German.

174
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,070
Your eyes were open, but you weren't there, Jimmy.

175
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,576
I'm afraid you're gonna hurt us.

176
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:56,168
I want to protect you and Tommy.

177
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,136
Sit down.

178
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,605
I didn't write to you when I was away in France

179
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,068
because I didn't think I was coming back.

180
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:26,698
There are things inside me that I brought home from the war.

181
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:32,621
But there were nights over there in the trenches, I'd be asleep,

182
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,251
dream that I could feel you next to me,

183
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,796
that I could touch your hair against my face.

184
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,842
You and Tommy, you're...

185
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,890
We both did things

186
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,851
when we were apart

187
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,771
for whatever reason.

188
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,527
Were you in love with her?

189
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,534
I was lonely, Jimmy.

190
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,747
I wanna start fresh.

191
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,460
I wanna go back to where we were.

192
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,758
Can you do that?

193
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,387
I think so.

194
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,140
Can you?

195
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,353
I'll try.

196
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:05,380
And on this Eve of All Hallows, we honor the saints

197
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,800
and now pray for the souls of the dead.

198
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,638
Oh, Lord, hear my prayer,

199
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,515
listen to my cry for mercy,

200
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,602
and in your faithfulness and righteousness

201
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,562
come to my relief.

202
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,107
Do not bring your servant unto judgment,

203
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:29,237
for no one living is righteous before you.

204
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,408
Do you pray much yourself?

205
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,204
For the children, mostly, for their health,

206
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,707
and the ones I lost, of course.

207
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,835
- And I pray for forgiveness.
- For what?

208
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,295
My own sins.

209
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,092
There's such a peacefulness here, a special kind of quiet.

210
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,553
It's like walking through a wood on a crisp autumn...

211
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,599
Oh.

212
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,486
So you have that in common.

213
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,784
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

214
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:20,664
Mr. Thompson in Chicago, he told me he had a son who died.

215
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,505
It's not suspicion. It's prudence.

216
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,216
Come on, Nuck, how long we know each other?

217
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,552
I'd like to know what I'll be walking into, John.

218
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,803
A business meeting.

219
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,389
For which I'm asking you to keep an open mind.

220
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,183
I already bought the Brooklyn Bridge, if that's what you're selling.

221
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,728
Noon tomorrow. We'll pick a spot out by you.

222
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,187
Ow, God damn it.

223
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,440
The train. How you think?

224
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,151
Go see who that is.

225
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,360
What?

226
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,529
I'm on the overnight train.

227
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,906
The fuck is going on over there?

228
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,617
Nothing. I'm late for a party.

229
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,745
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

230
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,933
Yes?

231
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,853
Someone wishes to see you.

232
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,534
Leave it on. It suits you.

233
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,996
A dapper villain in a Sunday serial.

234
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,081
And you?

235
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,751
What's your get-up tonight?

236
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,045
The devoted, pleading wife,

237
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,423
the temperance firebrand, the crusading suffragette?

238
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,885
You left out "kept woman."

239
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,514
But there wasn't any keeping you, was there?

240
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,558
When you met me, I was pregnant.

241
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,437
And then I lost the baby.

242
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,900
You lost a child,

243
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,569
a son.

244
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,947
He was six days old,

245
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,907
and your wife a month later.

246
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,702
It's a bit late for this game, wouldn't you say?

247
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,121
- What game?
- I tell you my sorrows,

248
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,834
you pretend to be sympathetic, and we wind up in bed.

249
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,503
I can assure you that won't happen.

250
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,843
Why are you here?

251
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,596
To find out who Enoch Thompson is.

252
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,274
Seven years ago, almost eight,

253
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,777
I'd just become treasurer.

254
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,865
I was new to the job, very busy.

255
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,410
My wife had just given birth.

256
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,539
We named him Enoch after me.

257
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,126
She wanted that.

258
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,635
He was tiny, frail.

259
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,055
I was terrified to hold him.

260
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,642
A week passed.

261
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:33,940
I had my hands full with some county business or another, an audit.

262
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,444
I was busy, very busy.

263
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,490
I came home one night.

264
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,701
It was late.

265
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,706
She was in the nursery, rocking him in her arms.

266
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,375
I crossed to them.

267
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,132
She looked so calm, so contented.

268
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,011
It gave me the courage to finally wanna hold him.

269
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,349
I pulled back the blanket,

270
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,199
and I looked at his face.

271
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,911
And I could tell right away

272
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,748
he'd been dead for days.

273
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,378
She'd been caring for him nearly a week.

274
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:42,300
Bathing him, changing his diapers, his bedclothes.

275
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:51,226
I took him from her and cradled him in my arms.

276
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,439
That was the only time I ever held him.

277
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,028
We buried him in the churchyard,

278
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,572
but she couldn't accept it.

279
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,326
She'd completely broken with reality.

280
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,246
Melancholia.

281
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,001
I saw it.

282
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,420
I knew it.

283
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:22,632
But the doctor said time would heal her.

284
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,762
And I was very, very busy.

285
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,021
A few weeks later,

286
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,274
she slashed her wrists with my razor.

287
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:56,082
The times with you and the children in the house,

288
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,087
eating breakfast, just that,

289
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,050
I've never been happier

290
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,304
or more terrified in my life.

291
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,395
And now you know more about me than any other person on earth.

292
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,151
And you thought I needed saving.

293
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,403
Didn't you?

294
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,158
Not the way you chose.

295
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,834
You'll leave Atlantic City?

296
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,882
- Is that your demand?
- It's just a question.

297
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,097
I think it might be for the best.

298
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,813
- Let me...
- No.

299
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,065
Thank you.

300
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,740
There's a kindness in you.

301
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,409
I know it.

302
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,998
How can you do what you do?

303
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:25,004
We all have to decide for ourselves how much sin we can live with.

304
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,344
Mr. Thompson.

305
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,389
Mrs. Schroeder.

306
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,476
I'm pleased to have finally made your acquaintance.

307
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,753
- Would you care for a biscuit?
- The molasses hurts my filling.

308
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:16,055
I was offered a permanent assignment in Atlantic City.

309
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,393
I discovered a large still near where Sebso expired.

310
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,439
We had originally gone to the area looking for it.

311
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,067
- Your supervisor must have been pleased.
- He was.

312
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:32,822
I was offered a raise in pay as well as two additional agents under my command.

313
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,158
That's wonderful.

314
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,035
I turned him down.

315
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,166
My Uncle Byron, I never told you this,

316
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,794
but a year ago last Easter, he made me a proposition,

317
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,298
full partner in his feed business.

318
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,134
In Schenectady.

319
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,971
You enjoyed our visit there, the winter with the snowshoes.

320
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:04,229
Of course I'd have to buy in, but it's a going concern.

321
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,864
You're being awfully quiet.

322
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,577
I like being the wife of a federal agent.

323
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,997
Is that what's important, your vanity?

324
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,917
What your friends think down at the greengrocer's?

325
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,461
- Of course not.
- I'm unhappy, Rose.

326
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,759
Unfulfilled. Increasingly so these last few months.

327
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,599
And now with Agent Sebso's death...

328
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:50,066
You're doing God's work there, Nelson.

329
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:59,242
Then, if God wants me to stay in Atlantic City, let him give me a sign.

330
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,519
- What the hell is this?
- Thanks for coming.

331
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,605
- How're you doing, kid?
- Mr. Torrio.

332
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,315
I don't like being sandbagged.

333
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,609
Come on. Costs nothing to listen.

334
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,989
Then start talking.

335
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,453
The last time we was all together, there was another man as well.

336
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,039
- Big Jim Colosimo.
- May he rest in peace.

337
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,125
He was a good man, Jim, don't get me wrong. But he didn't look ahead.

338
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,670
He didn't look from behind neither, from what Frankie Yale told me.

339
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,172
Grow up, huh?

340
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,216
With the stupid jokes.

341
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:43,721
My point is, to survive in a business like ours, you gotta look to the future.

342
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,642
And to do that, sometimes you gotta let go of the past.

343
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,228
It was Arnold who reached out, asked that we meet.

344
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,063
The son of a bitch tried to have me killed.

345
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,274
I'm interested, Mr. Thompson, in putting an end to our hostilities.

346
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,736
I would think you would be, considering the way things are going.

347
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,947
We could wage war for years.

348
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,075
It benefits no one.

349
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,078
And the fact is I have enough problems already.

350
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,371
Yes, I've seen the newspapers.

351
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,249
Then you know I'm about to be indicted for fixing the World Series.

352
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,376
- So pay someone off.
- There's the rub.

353
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:17,755
Though I'm quite well known in Chicago, I'm decidedly not well liked there.

354
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,174
It sounds to me like you're asking for a favor.

355
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,760
I'm asking to make a deal.

356
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:25,972
I need a man with your political reach to quash the indictment.

357
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:33,980
- That could be arranged.
- What?

358
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,524
We're talking.

359
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,363
In exchange for what?

360
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,116
One million in cash.

361
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:51,873
A million dollars.

362
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,042
And the location of the remaining D'Alessio brothers.

363
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,756
Or you could take your chances in Chicago with my good friend Hartley Replogle.

364
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,468
The State's Attorney.

365
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,470
So you've seen the papers, also.

366
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,562
This war ends here.

367
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,397
Any bad blood,

368
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:21,277
past transgressions of whatever nature, business or personal, are hereby nullified.

369
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,492
I'll have the cash delivered to you in the morning.

370
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,619
Charlie here has the other information you want.

371
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,580
Good luck, Mr. Thompson.

372
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,333
I do hope we haven't seen the last of each other.

373
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,127
Now, if you'll excuse me,

374
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,339
I've got a train to Chicago.

375
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,770
Get my brother on the phone,

376
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,272
then call an emergency press conference today at City Hall.

377
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,107
- What time? - 3:00 p.m. Sharp.

378
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,694
I want every newspaper in the county there.

379
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,124
Gentlemen of the Fourth Estate,

380
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:22,588
tragic though it is, I need hardly remind you that the passage of the 18th Amendment

381
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,883
has given rise to a new breed of criminal.

382
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,887
Vicious thugs emboldened by the promise of an easy dollar.

383
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,935
What the fuck are you doing? Halloween's over.

384
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,401
Last January, in the woods

385
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,404
only a few miles from where I speak to you today,

386
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,907
a horrible massacre occurred.

387
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,535
Five men, bootleggers all,

388
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,372
were cut down in cold blood by a rival gang.

389
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:03,004
The suspected ringleader of the killers, Hans Schroeder, was found dead days later,

390
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:07,341
his body washed up in a fishing net on one of our piers.

391
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:11,345
Due to the tireless work of my brother,

392
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:15,683
former Sheriff Eli Thompson, we have since learned

393
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,478
that Schroeder's conspirators in this cowardly attack

394
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,773
were a group of killers late of Philadelphia,

395
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:26,152
well-known to law enforcement as the D'Alessio brothers.

396
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:32,992
I am happy to report they are being sought for questioning as I speak.

397
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,418
Motivated by political gain,

398
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:47,048
the Democrats have argued that the incumbent administration

399
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:51,135
has been rife with corruption, soft on crime.

400
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:55,431
On this election eve, I submit to you this:

401
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:59,935
While this heinous crime did certainly occur on the Republican watch,

402
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,065
the apprehension of those responsible did as well.

403
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:27,922
Vote for Edward Bader tomorrow and keep our city safe.

404
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:32,343
I thank you all, and God bless America.

405
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,138
How about a picture with your brother?

406
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,648
No more pictures. Let's go. Come on.

407
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,108
Go, go, go, go.

408
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,789
How are you today? Nice to see you.

409
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,291
All right, a good day to vote, isn't it? Yes, sir.

410
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,376
Hey, how are you?

411
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,836
Hello, how are you?

412
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,880
Nice to see you. Congratulations, ladies.

413
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,091
- Good day.
- Thank you.

414
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,175
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

415
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:16,095
All right, thanks for coming out. Nice to see you.

416
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,556
How are you? Hello there.

417
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,433
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you. Thanks for coming out.

418
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,600
- Hey, Mr. Thompson.
- How are you today?

419
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,061
- Hi, Francis. How's your mother?
- Much better, Nucky.

420
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,980
Hello, Bill. How are you?

421
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,356
Good day, Mr. Thompson.

422
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,984
Hi, Mr. Thompson.

423
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,242
How are you? Nice to see you today.

424
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,161
Hey, squirt, who you voting for?

425
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,872
- Hey, good luck to you, Nucky.
- How are you?

426
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,248
- Attaboy, Nuck.
- Hi.

427
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,001
- Some turnout, huh?
- Say, Nuck, who you voting for?

428
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,545
Ed Bader and the straight Republican ticket.

429
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,173
And I suggest you all do the same.

430
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,869
Ange?

431
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,877
Hey, buddy.

432
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,423
- Where's your mother?
- I don't know.

433
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:42,473
I'm right here. I was in the bedroom.

434
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,395
Your father called. He asked to see you.

435
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,517
That uniform looks like it fits you.

436
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,563
How much?

437
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,859
Third ward results are in. We're up by over 20%.

438
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,949
Easy, kid. What, are you down a quart?

439
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,619
- It's great times here.
- Champagne, here you go.

440
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,708
It just came over the wire.

441
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:57,047
The State's Attorney in Chicago announced that Arnold Rothstein will not be indicted.

442
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,465
Anything on the mayor's race?

443
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,302
Well, the polls will be closing shortly.

444
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,934
Almost home, little brother.

445
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,395
Just like that, huh?

446
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,482
You wave your scepter and everything's all forgiven?

447
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,444
Your cut of the Rothstein money isn't enough?

448
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,612
Should I send flowers, too?

449
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,406
You fucked me over, brother. You forget?

450
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,867
And I told you I'll make it right.

451
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:30,247
You do this stuff, you say things.

452
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,709
Maybe you're so used to spouting bullshit, you don't realize it,

453
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,794
but your words actually do affect people.

454
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,255
What's that? Dale Carnegie?

455
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,506
I'm fucking serious, Nucky.

456
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,551
There are consequences to what you say, to what you do,

457
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,554
that you can't buy yourself out of with money.

458
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,974
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

459
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,854
You have to trust me, Eli.

460
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,731
What does that mean?

461
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,820
- That blood is thicker than water.
- Yeah?

462
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,115
Well, why'd it have to be my blood?

463
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,742
Happy days, boys, happy days.

464
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,620
Edgar Caldwell from campaign headquarters.

465
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,458
Let me take this.

466
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,969
Hello.

467
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,479
Frank Hague! What, did they run you out of Jersey City?

468
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,981
Who let the Democrat in?

469
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,401
You don't gotta be Irish to march in the St. Patty's Day parade, do you?

470
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,195
No, but it helps. Come on.

471
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,905
Good to see you.

472
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:49,827
Gentlemen and fellow Republicans, may I have your attention, please?

473
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,913
I have just been informed that as of three minutes ago,

474
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,749
Atlantic City has a new mayor.

475
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,084
Mr. Edward Bader.

476
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,422
Congratulations.

477
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:07,302
Thank you one and all for your kind applause and your generous support.

478
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,640
Now, being a man of action, I feel I should get right down to business.

479
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,934
Sheriff Halloran.

480
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,602
At your service, Mr. Mayor.

481
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:20,107
Sheriff Halloran, after your long and meritorious service to Atlantic City,

482
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,818
I regretfully accept your resignation.

483
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,115
Is this a joke?

484
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,951
Relax, kid. It's what Nucky wants.

485
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:37,332
And now, as my second official act as mayor, it is my pleasure

486
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:41,962
to reappoint my good friend Eli Thompson as sheriff of Atlantic County.

487
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,630
- Hear, hear.
- Hear.

488
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,260
Welcome back, Eli.

489
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,394
Well, looks like there's a new sheriff in town.

490
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,812
Jimmy.

491
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,231
You're looking well.

492
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,651
Good old Paddy Ryan,

493
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,029
chief clerk of the fourth ward.

494
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,031
How you been?

495
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,200
I'm aces, Paddy.

496
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,243
How's life in politics?

497
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,495
Swell.

498
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,997
Nuck's taking good care of me.

499
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,834
He must have pimped out your mother as well.

500
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:22,878
I beg your pardon?

501
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:26,256
Your mother, he must have pimped your mother out as...

502
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,010
What the fuck is wrong with you?

503
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,386
What?

504
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:34,973
Nothing.

505
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,519
You're my hero.

506
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,020
What are you talking about?

507
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:43,732
The way you work, Nuck, you're like a machine.

508
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,653
Clean, fast, totally devoid of any emotion.

509
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:48,779
Halloran wasn't working out.

510
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,156
Halloran? You'll use anyone, Nuck.

511
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,034
Man, woman, 13-year-old girl.

512
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,997
She was an orphan, James.

513
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,874
Living in a home for wayward children.

514
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,544
- The Commodore took good care of her.
- I'll bet he did.

515
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,420
And then you took care of me.

516
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,965
Well, I did, didn't I?

517
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,716
Did you ever want for anything?

518
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,344
Need anything? You ever miss a meal?

519
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,273
So the learning at your feet, getting me into Princeton,

520
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,817
that was all guilt? Huh?

521
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,443
Guilt, duty.

522
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,155
You're a grown man now. What difference does it make?

523
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,117
I thought you loved me.

524
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,246
I'm not your father, James.

525
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,375
You're right.

526
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,335
I'm going to go take it up with him.

527
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,380
Why don't you do yourself a favor?

528
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,799
Go home to your wife and sober up.

529
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,510
Why don't you do me a favor, Nuck?

530
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:56,972
Stop acting like you give a shit.

531
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:11,945
Come on now, everyone, eat your cake. We still haven't found the surprises.

532
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,618
- Anything in there?
- No.

533
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,459
The ring.

534
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,378
It means I'll be married, right?

535
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,423
May it bring you better luck than it did me.

536
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,801
The First Lady of the United States.

537
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:47,147
What will you do, Nan, if he doesn't send for you?

538
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:54,321
Well, of course he will. He said.

539
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,493
I didn't get a prize.

540
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,247
Well, there's still more cake left, dear.

541
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,502
The rag.

542
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,507
What does that mean, Mama?

543
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:20,055
Nothing, dear. It's just a silly superstition.

544
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,033
Sir.

545
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,452
There's some woman out front. She's looking for you.

546
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,455
Send her in.

547
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,159
I went to your rooming house.

548
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,828
The landlady told me you worked here.

549
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,831
What do you want?

550
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,421
You a postman, Nelson?

551
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,300
No, I'm a Prohibition Agent.

552
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,429
Hmm.

553
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,727
Well, you made me pregnant.

554
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,449
- Come on now. Warm milk.
- No.

555
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,870
Put a little brandy in it, would you?

556
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,414
We're trying to rebuild your stomach lining.

557
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:11,666
Well, then cook me a steak.

558
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,383
So we're a happy family all of a sudden?

559
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,803
You don't have to be so fretful all the time.

560
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,138
I'll make you some eggs.

561
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,979
Jimmy, give me some of that.

562
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,006
You realize this is the first time we've ever had a drink together?

563
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,384
Don't tell your mother.

564
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,307
The woman tries to kill me

565
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:13,520
and Nucky lets her go.

566
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,857
He's got an odd sense of justice.

567
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,567
Talk to me about justice?

568
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:22,487
Fucking Woodrow Wilson, when he was governor,

569
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,781
goddamn southern son of a bitch

570
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,700
comes here to try to make a name for himself

571
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,702
so he can run for president.

572
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,204
He's the reason you went to jail.

573
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:36,042
No, he's the reason I got convicted. Nucky's the reason I went to jail.

574
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,468
What do you mean?

575
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,011
Well, he was sheriff at the time.

576
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:49,264
We got caught up in some election-rigging case.

577
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,975
They couldn't get us both, so this fucking Wilson

578
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,686
makes a deal with the prosecutor.

579
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,565
One of us takes the fall, Wilson gets the headline.

580
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,567
The rest of the case goes away.

581
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,277
Why you and not Nucky?

582
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:06,031
I was hurt politically and Nucky was the fair-haired boy.

583
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,991
The plan was for me to go away.

584
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,912
He'd take over and then square things up when I got out.

585
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,915
- Did he?
- He squared things up all right.

586
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,586
Five years in jail and I was just a distant memory.

587
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:24,758
And there he is with a diamond stick pin and a Rolls-fucking-Royce.

588
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:30,680
Nucky Thompson, the spawn of a drunken piney.

589
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,789
I used to hate coming here when I was a kid.

590
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,209
My mother would bring me here to see you.

591
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,129
I know.

592
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,966
I was afraid of all the animals.

593
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,760
I was afraid of you.

594
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:12,430
Nucky told me, "It's your duty.

595
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,641
"Gotta be strong for your mother."

596
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,936
Manipulative son of a bitch.

597
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,147
He can be.

598
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:28,863
Jimmy,

599
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:34,828
you think I don't know why he brought you back from Chicago?

600
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,665
To do what he doesn't have the stomach for.

601
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,751
And you said yes.

602
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,295
What for?

603
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,673
- A few percent off top?
- I made a good deal.

604
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,759
God, he made you think you did.

605
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,595
He made me think I did.

606
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,638
That's the way he operates.

607
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,473
You know him well.

608
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,892
He was like a son to me.

609
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:01,146
But you're my flesh and blood, boy.

610
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,191
So?

611
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:10,488
So you're gonna take back Atlantic City for the both of us.

612
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,869
And how is that supposed to work?

613
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:18,163
Look around, son.

614
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,750
I didn't get all this by being stupid.

615
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,213
Sir.

616
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,437
You told him what we discussed?

617
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,273
I'm just about to.

618
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:56,117
So, you see, if I were president, I'd run the country like a Broadway show.

619
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:00,163
I'd pick my cabinet and try them out right here in Atlantic City.

620
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:04,209
Oh, yes, the best audiences.

621
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,418
And if they clicked here,

622
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,338
I'd let them open in New York and a few other cities.

623
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:14,219
We'd do one-night stands for four years and by then they'd have to re-elect me

624
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:17,597
so I could actually do something at the White House.

625
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,884
Mr. Thompson. Mr. Thompson.

626
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,430
How do you do?

627
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:01,683
Baxter, it's nice to see you.

628
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,145
I see you've met Annabelle.

629
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,522
George was telling me all about the cutlery business.

630
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,567
Yeah, I'll knife you and spoon you and fork you as well.

631
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,072
How about a dance?

632
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,871
- Margaret.
- Hello.

633
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,625
What a pleasant surprise.

634
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,379
I heard the news about Mayor Bader.

635
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,672
Congratulations.

636
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:17,592
Well, I certainly owe a debt of gratitude to you.

637
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,053
Then you could offer me a drink.

638
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,308
Is champagne okay?

639
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,145
Good news just isn't the same without it.

640
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,115
How are the children?

641
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,496
They miss their Uncle Nucky.

642
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,627
Quiet, everyone! Quiet. Quiet.

643
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,420
We got it on the wireless. Quiet.

644
00:52:54,505 --> 00:53:00,593
Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Florida, Michigan,

645
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:04,013
North Carolina and Rhode Island.

646
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,225
Once again, ladies and gentlemen, this is Frank Conrad

647
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,018
with the official results of the election

648
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,604
transmitting live over the wireless from Pittsburgh.

649
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,273
Pittsburgh! Can you believe it?

650
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,732
Pipe down, lady.

651
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:20,029
With 48 states reporting, it's Warren Harding with nearly 60% of the popular vote.

652
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,032
Yes, yes, and this just in.

653
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,119
Challenger James M. Cox has moments ago conceded

654
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,913
to a capacity crowd at Dayton Fairgrounds.

655
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:31,291
Ladies and gentlemen, Warren Gamaliel Harding

656
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,627
has been elected the 29th president of the United States!

657
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:50,935
What a momentous evening this has been for the senator from Ohio.

658
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:54,564
His decisive victory a credit to both himself

659
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,317
and to the entire Republican party.

660
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,529
And now this, from Mr. Harding's acceptance speech.

661
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:04,407
I read to you directly from the ticker.

662
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:09,537
"My countrymen, America's present need is not heroics, but healing.

663
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,790
"Not revolution, but restoration.

664
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,002
"Not agitation, but adjustment.

665
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:19,297
"Not surgery, but serenity.

666
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,800
"Not the dramatic, but the dispassionate.

667
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:25,011
"The world calls for peace.

668
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,806
"We need not nostrums, but a return to normalcy."

669
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,507
Thank you, Babette. Thank you, Nucky.

670
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,551
Thank you, Nucky.

671
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,470
Thank you.

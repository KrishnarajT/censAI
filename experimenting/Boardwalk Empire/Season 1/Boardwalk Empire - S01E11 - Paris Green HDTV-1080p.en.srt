2
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,006
Six minutes and 30 seconds.

3
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,217
Is it meant to take this long?

4
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,136
Not as far as I'm concerned.

5
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,805
Get his brother!

6
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,474
What's with you?

7
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,310
Makes me nervous is all.

8
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,395
You're not the one tied up, baby.

9
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,078
Bravo!

10
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,554
You're off somewhere again.

11
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,765
Was I? Sorry.

12
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,854
Thinking about what?

13
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,816
I don't know if I'm thinking about anything.

14
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,484
You don't know if you were thinking?

15
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,987
Isn't that possible?

16
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,626
Hello.

17
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,630
What do you want me to do about it?

18
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,136
Okay. Okay.

19
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,014
I'm doing this for you.

20
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,475
Tomorrow. All right. Bye.

21
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,363
It was my mother.

22
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,827
My father's dying.

23
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,512
You're quite adept with those.

24
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,806
It's easy once you get the hang of it.

25
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,350
And when did that occur?

26
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,561
- What?
- How did you get the hang of it?

27
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,148
I was a clerk for an importer on White Street,

28
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,403
Black & Geddes in Manhattan.
Ate in Chinatown a lot.

29
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,531
- It was cheap.
- You craved more excitement,

30
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,950
joined the Bureau.

31
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,535
- I suppose.
- And you found it, didn't you,

32
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,080
in mortal combat with our witness?

33
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,291
I don't really like to talk about it, sir.

34
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,710
Self-defense in the line of duty is no crime.

35
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,462
I know. It's just...

36
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,675
I wish it'd turned out differently.

37
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,301
With you dead instead of him?

38
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,594
Of course not.

39
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,891
He set upon you unexpectedly,

40
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,687
under the pretense of his need to micturate.

41
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,315
Assaulted you with a stone.

42
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,150
That's right.

43
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,194
- And you shot him?
- I had to.

44
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,155
- In the forehead?
- The chest.

45
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,699
He hit you in the forehead?

46
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,325
Yes.

47
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,994
Hmm.

48
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:40,589
So he was facing you
while he unsheathed himself.

49
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,387
And yet he had a stone that you did not see

50
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,347
until he hit you with it.

51
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,059
He grabbed for it, I don't know. He scrambled.

52
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,604
It all happened so quickly.

53
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,194
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

54
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,366
The thought of what ingredients
might constitute this filth repulses me.

55
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,310
Where is it?

56
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,732
Look.

57
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,569
- Bravo.
- I didn't feel a thing.

58
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,073
I knew you were misleading me,
yet you managed it anyway.

59
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,825
Deception requires complicity,
however subconscious.

60
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,994
We want to be deceived.

61
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,204
Do I have to give it back?

62
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,248
I'm a magician, Miss, not a thief.

63
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,834
There's an excuse
that might come in handy someday.

64
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,504
Thank you.

65
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,260
I saw your brother
do that straitjacket gag once.

66
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,970
Hanging from the top of the garden pier.

67
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,640
Five feet or 50, the principle is the same.

68
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,975
Until the rope breaks.

69
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,769
Erik, Houdini as you know him,

70
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,105
used to do that escape behind the ghost box,

71
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,981
where no one could see him.

72
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,566
Playing it out in the open was my idea.

73
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,443
Oh, yes. Well, that's much better.

74
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,863
And the Milk Can Escape,
my innovation as well.

75
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,870
It's no small feat for a grown man
to slip himself inside a tin container.

76
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,455
Try a corset and heels.

77
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:41,252
I'm sure Mr. Hardeen has had occasion
to help many women escape from those.

78
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,045
The most challenging trick of all.

79
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,048
Jesus Christ!

80
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,218
Doesn't anybody here
read a goddamn newspaper?

81
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,387
I do.

82
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,805
Then you know I'm fucking ruined.

83
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,348
There are ladies present, sir.

84
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,059
I don't give a cunt's hair, you fucking boob.

85
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,478
My investment.

86
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,732
The Italian fellow I told you about
up in Boston, he was arrested.

87
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,025
Charles Ponzi?

88
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,903
It was a swindle from start to finish.

89
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:12,908
I was in up to the limit
and he took me like some out-of-town jasper.

90
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,077
Every shell game needs a mark.

91
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,914
Nobody legit can guarantee
a return like that, Harry.

92
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,791
I don't have a nickel.

93
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,586
I'm dead.

94
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,463
I'm sitting here right now, but...

95
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,716
I'm dead.

96
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,552
You're totally broke?

97
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,721
We'll be okay, doll.

98
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,139
Won't we?

99
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,435
Sure we will. We'll pull through. You'll see.

100
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,687
You fat, worthless fool.

101
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,272
Belle, wait.

102
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,113
Well, what other tricks do you know?

103
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,746
You know I've never sought notoriety.

104
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,249
Well, it's about to be seeking you, my friend.

105
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,542
Half the team's indicted.

106
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,461
These players,

107
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,797
Cicotte, Gandil,
where would I have met them?

108
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,634
You've met Sport Sullivan.

109
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,928
And Abe Attell, obviously.
They're named, too.

110
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,473
Poor Abe.
One too many haymakers to the head.

111
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,768
If he hits the mat on this,
he could very well take you with him.

112
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,394
A girl goes to bed with 10 fellows,

113
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,314
who's gonna believe her
when she says the eleventh is the father?

114
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,859
Arnold, I admire your sangfroid,

115
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,071
but I'm not the person you need to convince.

116
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,573
You were concerned enough
to retain my services,

117
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,575
and I'm telling you now
your concerns were justified.

118
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,911
What do you propose?

119
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,330
Come here, to Chicago.

120
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,415
Into the lion's den?

121
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,126
Yes. But before you do that,

122
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,587
I want you to think hard
about who in this town

123
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,297
is willing to do you a favor.

124
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,737
Commodore, sir.

125
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,989
Jesus.

126
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,450
What is it?

127
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,286
Your visitor, he's here.

128
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:21,996
Oh.

129
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,039
Good.

130
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,209
Show him in.

131
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,893
There's the boy.

132
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,439
May I get you something, sir?

133
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,691
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

134
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,401
Nonsense. Get him a drink.

135
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,613
No, no, you go on. I'll do it.

136
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,413
Leave that there, for Christ's sake.

137
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,460
So...

138
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,629
Look at you.

139
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,424
A proper gentleman.

140
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,053
My mother raised me well.

141
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:21,764
Biscuit?

142
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,484
Yeah, he passed last night.

143
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,614
Whimpering, vomiting,
couldn't find a place to settle.

144
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,534
I couldn't do a damn thing.

145
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,496
It's a fucking dog.

146
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,748
You're a stony little bastard.

147
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,542
I'm what time and circumstance
have made me.

148
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,504
Your mother keeps me informed.

149
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,339
Those must be pleasant conversations.

150
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,636
You have no concept of the ways
that people can be close.

151
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,099
I have a pretty good idea.
You were 54. She was 13.

152
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,853
You'd have done the same thing.

153
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,397
You don't know me very well.

154
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,483
Oh, I know you backwards and forwards.

155
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,112
You want anything
you can lay your hands on,

156
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,115
and nothing's gonna stop you from getting it.

157
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,661
I expect nothing less from my son, though.

158
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,084
This reunion over?

159
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,170
I'm dying, boy.

160
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,885
Well, then I will call you a priest.

161
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,013
You know what this town was
before I came here?

162
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,852
A fucking swamp.

163
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,106
Sand blowing through
shitty boarding houses.

164
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,191
Nobody wanted to come here.

165
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,361
But I drained that swamp.

166
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,366
I paved those streets. I put up those hotels.

167
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,662
I made this fucking city.

168
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,707
You and your giant blue ox, right?

169
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,333
Don't sass me, boy.

170
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,296
I'm just trying to tell you something.

171
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,215
What are you trying to tell me?

172
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,096
The wrong man is running this town.

173
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,900
- Where are you going?
- I don't feel well.

174
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,015
He knows I'm unhappy,
but he'd never dream I'd leave.

175
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,059
Neither would Robert.

176
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,187
Pack lightly.
One suitcase for you and Tommy both.

177
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,856
We can buy whatever we need
once we're abroad.

178
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,525
I'd like a fresh start anyway.

179
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,862
The man from Cunard says
we're to be at the dock an hour early.

180
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,656
We'll meet here, and then go to...

181
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,115
God damn it!

182
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,493
Dearest?

183
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,578
Hello?

184
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,707
I'm helpless on these damned things.

185
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,293
I spilled developer on my trousers.

186
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,587
- It's all over the floor.
- I'll get it later. Sit.

187
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,562
I'll see you later, Mary.

188
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,572
What were you two conspiring about?

189
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:08,907
What?

190
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,451
I heard hushed voices.

191
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,662
Oh. Just girl talk.

192
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,666
Well, you do like your little games, don't you?

193
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,752
You seem to enjoy them yourself.

194
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,505
Very wicked, my love.

195
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,856
Where are you calling from?

196
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,024
The lobby.

197
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,067
Are you out of your fucking mind?

198
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,862
I couldn't call from the post office.
It wasn't safe.

199
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,530
You were cleared, weren't you?

200
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,365
There's nothing he can do.

201
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,034
He's not letting go of this.

202
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,661
Then give him something he can't argue with.

203
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:55,829
Like what?

204
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,791
You're a Prohi, aren't you?

205
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,210
- Go find bootleggers.
- Any suggestions?

206
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,965
Head out toward Mays Landing,
along the Black Horse.

207
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,053
I wouldn't be surprised if there was
a major illegal distillery operating there.

208
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,179
How far?

209
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,680
You want me to make the arrest, too?

210
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,392
Just past mile marker 14, on the left.

211
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,020
Don't get spooked, kid.

212
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,688
No, sir.

213
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,900
Now go look like a hero,
and let's not talk again.

214
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,993
Yes, you're standing there.

215
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,247
A lady in distress.

216
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,875
That son of a bitch.

217
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,253
Annabelle, you can tell me whatever you want,

218
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,507
but don't scream, don't cry
and don't throw anything.

219
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,101
I had money under the floorboards.

220
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,395
Harry took it all.

221
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,230
How much?

222
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,899
$3,682.

223
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,778
I counted it every night.

224
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,988
And you want me to have him arrested.

225
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,448
I sure as hell do.

226
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,784
To get back the money you lifted from him.

227
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,245
I worked my tail off for it.

228
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,457
My little girl.

229
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,838
You said you wouldn't do this.

230
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,019
This will see you through the summer.

231
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,817
Come on, let's just skip to the part
where you say you'll do anything for me.

232
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,360
Well, I would.

233
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,989
Draw the curtains, and I'll do it right now.

234
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,700
What happened to the tears?

235
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,787
Ride me like you used to
and I'll soak the pillow through.

236
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,333
I'll keep that one in my pocket.

237
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,170
And he will, you know.

238
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,844
Mr. Thompson's gift is
to never forget who owes him what.

239
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,263
It's generally a good principle.

240
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,850
Harry found her stash and did a bunk.

241
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,934
I know.

242
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,605
Did you mention
I already gave you $50 myself?

243
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,024
I guess we're both a soft touch.

244
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,699
Thanks for helping a girl out.

245
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,501
I thought you might like to hear,

246
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,296
the League of Women Voters
is going to formally endorse Mr. Bader.

247
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,050
- That's wonderful.
- Then I'm glad to have been of use to you.

248
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,478
How did he look?

249
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,607
Looks like he's dying.

250
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,026
He smelled like garlic.

251
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,365
He says you two see each other.

252
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,244
We began keeping in touch.

253
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,580
We have you in common, after all.

254
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,252
When you enlisted, he called me.
He was very concerned.

255
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,257
He lost his brother at the Battle of Vicksburg.

256
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,551
Well, he needn't have worried.

257
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,845
I told him you would come back.

258
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,099
Lady Jean told me so.

259
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,768
The fortune-teller? Ma, Jesus.

260
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,603
She was right, wasn't she?

261
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,940
There's rhubarb pie.

262
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,528
You were 13 years old.

263
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,075
You were by yourself, and you had me.

264
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,288
I wasn't completely alone.

265
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,791
Nucky Thompson was looking after us.

266
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,004
And why was he doing that?

267
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,382
He was the sheriff.

268
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,051
He worked for your father and...

269
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,515
You remember this?

270
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,231
May Day, 1897.

271
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,985
I was one of King Neptune's consorts.

272
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,657
Your father saw me.

273
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,203
And Nucky worked for him,
and later that day...

274
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,539
Well, that night, really.

275
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,833
Nucky brought me to him

276
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,296
because that was one of the things
he did for the Commodore.

277
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,092
And we proceeded in that fashion
for some time.

278
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,391
A pimp.

279
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,271
An ambitious young man

280
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,440
who wanted to get ahead.

281
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,860
He had a wife.

282
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,321
He wanted to start a family.

283
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,906
And that makes it okay?

284
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,492
You remember Mabel?

285
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,953
She was a lovely woman.

286
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,538
It's a tragedy.

287
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,337
Nucky has been kind in his way

288
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,548
to you and me both.

289
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,180
I suppose the whole affair
has always bothered him.

290
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,894
Do you remember how long this used to be?

291
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:55,772
Mmm.

292
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,947
I told the doctor that I'd meet him
at your father's house.

293
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,452
No one deserves to die alone.

294
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,063
That was the marker a little ways back.

295
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,898
It should be around here somewhere.

296
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,777
And this anonymous source

297
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,780
wouldn't have any reason to lie?

298
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,375
You think maybe there's a...

299
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,793
Quiet.

300
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,992
What are they doing here?

301
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,369
Now we ain't doing nothing wrong here.

302
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,747
Gentlemen.

303
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:41,127
Special Agent Van Alden
with the Bureau of Internal Revenue.

304
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,714
What's going on here?

305
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,469
Just strengthening the Lord's army,
one lost soul at a time.

306
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,972
I call it "the week of miracles."

307
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,601
"And John did baptize in the wilderness."

308
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,356
Deacon Cuffy,
Shiloh Baptist Church of Atlantic City.

309
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,150
As far as I know, we are breaking no laws, sir.

310
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,861
You think Christ hears you
in this forsaken place?

311
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,863
Jesus is a wonder worker, sir.

312
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,990
He hears everybody everywhere.

313
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,619
- From the hollows to the hills.
- Yes, Lord.

314
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,121
Just words, Deacon.

315
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,289
No, sir. It's the gospel.

316
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,708
And this gospel is truth.

317
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,836
Turn from it however you may,

318
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,047
but every road leads to a reckoning.

319
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,341
That is what you believe?

320
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,717
That's what I know.

321
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,470
And I'll stake my place
in the kingdom upon it.

322
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,013
- Oh, Lord.
- Praise Jesus.

323
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,098
Yes, Lord.

324
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,891
Then carry on.

325
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,021
He that believeth

326
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,399
and is baptized

327
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,484
shall be saved.

328
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,570
- Amen.
- Right now.

329
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,947
But he that believeth not

330
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:56,828
shall be condemned to the fires of damnation!

331
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,746
Shouldn't we be looking for that still?

332
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,749
Your people don't believe in heaven, do they?

333
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,042
My people?

334
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,670
Don't be glib. The Jews.

335
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,631
No, not exactly.

336
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,258
Rise up.

337
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,260
Rise up, brothers and sisters.

338
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,761
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

339
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,014
Sir, I know you're under a lot of strain...

340
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,268
But if you don't believe in heaven,
then how can you conceive of hell?

341
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,937
- Surrender yourselves.
- Yes, yes.

342
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,732
And rid yourselves of worldly sins.

343
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,859
- Hallelujah.
- And be set free,

344
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,028
unshackled,

345
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:35,366
free to do the Lord's work.

346
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,744
Amen. Amen.

347
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:38,953
Amen.

348
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,249
Let any man or woman with sin in their heart

349
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,210
come forward

350
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:52,217
to have that sin washed away
by the grace of Jesus Christ Almighty.

351
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:56,721
- Jesus Christ.
- Yes, yes.

352
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,328
Are you all right?

353
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,791
I am.

354
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,710
The question is, are you?

355
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,033
Eat, dear.

356
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,744
The angel of death.

357
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,790
I knew you would be beautiful.

358
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,047
He's quite jaundiced.

359
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,466
Has he urinated?

360
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,136
That chamber pot been empty for days.

361
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,639
There's something wrong
with every organ in his body.

362
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,731
- I'd like to run some tests.
- Is that really necessary?

363
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,275
Just let me die, damn it.

364
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,486
The Commodore don't like to be
fussed with, Doctor.

365
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,241
I just need a hair sample.

366
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,911
No. What are you doing?

367
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,079
- It's all right.
- No.

368
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,748
- Just a little piece of...
- No.

369
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,499
- Look.
- It's okay.

370
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,835
- No, he's trying to kill me.
- He's not trying to kill you, just...

371
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,171
- He's trying to kill me.
- Relax. Relax.

372
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,589
He's trying to help you.

373
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:55,840
Easy.

374
00:27:58,886 --> 00:27:59,886
He's trying to help you.

375
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,054
Yes.

376
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,099
Okay? Relax.

377
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,145
It's all right.
I'll just take a lock from the back here.

378
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,107
You're okay. You're okay.

379
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,494
You're a good son.

380
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,555
Have you eaten anything?

381
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,186
Somebody has to stay here for him.

382
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,271
I'll stay with him tonight.

383
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,982
So what's the point
of this gathering?

384
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,444
We don't have to go if you don't want to.

385
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,989
Most of these women were against suffrage
in the first place.

386
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,283
Not too big on immigrants either.

387
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,077
How did their own ancestors get here?

388
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,996
The Daughters of the American Revolution?

389
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,623
Why, they grew in the ground like pumpkins

390
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,043
and marched off with Washington
to Valley Forge.

391
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,214
I'll do what's required of me.

392
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,676
Not really the right answer.

393
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,721
What answer would you prefer?

394
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,392
What you saw...

395
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,398
What you thought you saw
in my office yesterday

396
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,983
couldn't have been more innocent.

397
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,945
Annabelle is far from innocent.

398
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,698
And I daresay
you've some experience yourself.

399
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,992
We had a relationship years ago.

400
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,661
It meant nothing.

401
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,580
I was helping her, Margaret. That's all.

402
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,624
The way you helped me?

403
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,417
I thought she was your friend.

404
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,254
So you wouldn't fuck her?

405
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,217
That language does not become you.

406
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,468
Yes.

407
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,305
- You'd rather I be demure.
- I'd rather you be rational.

408
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:50,765
Meaning what?

409
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:54,519
That I say nothing about what I see,
what I hear?

410
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,146
What have you heard?

411
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,566
That you are capable of anything.

412
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,777
And who told you that?

413
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,612
Agent Van Alden,

414
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,156
while you were out campaigning.

415
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:10,868
Well, if you didn't tell me about it,
it couldn't have been very upsetting.

416
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,163
It made me sick to my stomach.

417
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,291
This whole arrangement does.

418
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,626
What arrangement?

419
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,089
That I'm to accept what you tell me
and ask nothing more.

420
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,591
That I aid you in the business you conduct

421
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,511
and pretend I don't know
what that business is.

422
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:32,181
I don't recall you ever saying no
to anything I put in front of you.

423
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,058
You make a little noise every now and then

424
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,477
to remind me what a good person you are.

425
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,438
But a good person
wouldn't be here right now.

426
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,066
You don't know what I am.

427
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,901
I don't?

428
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,703
This is what you do.

429
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:58,249
After you lie down with me, you go in there,
wash your body with this poison,

430
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,333
like any whore.

431
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,752
I won't have another child.

432
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,505
- By me?
- By any man.

433
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,173
That's not your right to decide.

434
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,593
Why should you care? We're not married.

435
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,222
Do you expect that I would give you,
what, an heir?

436
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,932
Is that what you want me for?

437
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,309
I thought you needed saving.

438
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,977
And that's why you chose my husband.

439
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:19,604
What are you talking about?

440
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,565
You knew nothing of him until I came to you.

441
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,360
What purpose did it serve
to make me a widow?

442
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,737
You need to be careful now.

443
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,448
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm advising you.

444
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,283
Whatever idea you've gotten into your head...

445
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,744
Your brother came to me with money.

446
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,121
- To help you.
- To keep me quiet.

447
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,041
Well, you have been, haven't you?

448
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,169
Not a word about this man who beat you,

449
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,921
who murdered the baby you were carrying,

450
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,716
who you loved so very much.

451
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,303
I have not lost one second of sleep
over what was done,

452
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,596
and neither have you.

453
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,730
You won't be needing that anymore, will you?

454
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,569
Sir.

455
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,697
- Yes?
- Sir, you got a visitor.

456
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,908
Thank you.

457
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,457
How is your father?

458
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,751
He's on his way out.

459
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,295
Mmm. I'm sorry.

460
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,588
Honestly,

461
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,591
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

462
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,927
You're here for your mother.

463
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,137
- It's your duty.
- Yeah.

464
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,432
Chalky, Mr. White,

465
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,686
heard back from his man in Philadelphia.

466
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,020
Any sign of them?

467
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,606
Mrs. D'Alessio, the mother, is there,

468
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,110
the sisters and another brother.

469
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:50,945
Which one?

470
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,154
Adrian.

471
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,406
Never heard of him.

472
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,532
He's a dentist.

473
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,162
- I could go there.
- Where?

474
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:01,622
To Philadelphia.

475
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,792
What good is that?
They're lying low somewhere else.

476
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,129
I would kill the mother.

477
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,590
The sisters.

478
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,051
And the dentist.

479
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,888
That would make them stick their heads up.

480
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,476
Did you run your tests?

481
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,019
Yes.

482
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,190
I have some information.

483
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,360
We'll talk that over later, Richard.

484
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,745
We need to speak frankly.

485
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,288
Okay.

486
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:43,914
Are you the next of kin?

487
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,501
I'm pretty sure I'm not in the will,
if that's what you mean.

488
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,587
Who else stands to gain
from your father's death?

489
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,922
What are you talking about?

490
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,924
The tests are pretty crude,

491
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,386
but there's enough arsenic in his body
to take down a hippo.

492
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,599
I don't want to.

493
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,851
Yes, you do. You said so.

494
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,771
We're going sailing, remember?

495
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,773
You, me, Aunt Mary,

496
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,525
over the ocean to Paris.

497
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,943
Is Daddy coming?

498
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,362
No.

499
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,781
How come?

500
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,660
Daddy's already been there,
and he didn't like it.

501
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,413
Come on, hurry.

502
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,626
Aunt Mary is waiting.

503
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,045
Can Gillian come?

504
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,468
No. She doesn't like Paris, either.

505
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,649
Come on. Let's go meet Aunt Mary.

506
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:20,636
What's he do all day?

507
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,305
Sits there. He's upset about the house.

508
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,225
It's a miracle it didn't happen sooner.

509
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,480
The place was a firetrap.

510
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,236
So, your lady friend.

511
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,614
Tell me about this row.

512
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,408
It got very ugly.

513
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,369
I fight with June all the time.

514
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,414
We go out to the shed
to make sure the kids don't hear.

515
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,458
The mouth on her... You'd be surprised.

516
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,210
She knows, Eli.

517
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,421
She suspects, you mean.

518
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,798
How could she know?

519
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,474
You didn't tell her?

520
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,518
I didn't deny it either.

521
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:10,811
What the fuck were you thinking?

522
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:13,939
That I wanted to hurt her.

523
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,482
What do you think these are for?

524
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,067
That's not who I am.

525
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,402
It isn't?

526
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,487
Who told me to get rid of her husband?

527
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,281
He deserved it.

528
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,490
Deserved?

529
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,367
Who the fuck are you?

530
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,162
Leave that shit to God
and look after business.

531
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,039
She starts shooting her mouth off...

532
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,916
- She won't.
- How do you know?

533
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,001
How do you know anything?

534
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,378
I got a bullet in my gut
from what you don't know.

535
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,631
- Calm down, Eli.
- You need to wake up!

536
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,841
Fletcher gets elected,

537
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,427
and he is this close, brother.

538
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,470
You're telling me?

539
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,514
They are coming after us with pickaxes.

540
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,934
- This fucking woman...
- Margaret.

541
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,394
This woman is a liability

542
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,231
that you created, because, why?

543
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,567
She'll absolve you
of all the sinful shit on your hands?

544
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:00,027
- Oh, stop.
- What?

545
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,403
That's how you think.

546
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,947
I didn't ask for your insights.

547
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,531
This is my life on the line!

548
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,909
I got eight kids.

549
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,370
You waltz around town like it's a circus,

550
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,207
getting your ass kissed,
the king of the freak show.

551
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,292
Nobody cares about you.

552
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,628
They only care about what you can give them.

553
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,296
And that includes your Irish chippie

554
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,966
who you just handed a blank check.

555
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,886
You know, it's too bad
you didn't see Hardeen the other night.

556
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:27,763
What?

557
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,807
It's an entertaining act.

558
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,477
But if he wasn't Houdini's brother,
nobody'd give a fuck.

559
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,570
Hey.

560
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,073
How is he?

561
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,076
Well, he made it through another night.

562
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,079
I'm surprised.

563
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,543
You want some coffee?

564
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,092
How much money do you think he has?

565
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,885
Your father?

566
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,054
I have no idea.

567
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,016
But it's enough

568
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,561
to live comfortably, that's for sure.

569
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,230
I should hope so.

570
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,191
It certainly doesn't seem as if he's wanting.

571
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,027
No, it certainly doesn't.

572
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,790
Have you talked about
what would happen if he dies?

573
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,462
I don't know what you mean.

574
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,759
He said you two were close.

575
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:50,137
Well, "close" is a relative term.

576
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,310
I'm not quite sure
what you're getting at, sweetie.

577
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,979
Look, Ma,

578
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,648
it's fine with me, it really is.

579
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,068
Whatever you want to do.

580
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:08,155
The other day I ate a cookie at his house
and it made me vomit.

581
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,865
And this morning,

582
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,950
I found this.

583
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,330
Tucked down, hidden in his rubbish pail

584
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,958
in the kitchen.

585
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,924
"Fifty bucks?" the fellow says.

586
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:31,678
"Peter Stuyvesant paid only $24
for the entire island of Manhattan."

587
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,847
"Yeah," the whore replies,

588
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:37,059
"But Manhattan just lays there."

589
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,105
Peter Minuit.

590
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,816
- What?
- Peter Minuit bought Manhattan.

591
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,317
Okay.

592
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,194
Get your fucking facts straight.

593
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,947
- In a joke?
- You think it's funny?

594
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,116
That's the attitude,

595
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,868
the lack of attention to detail,
that's fucking killing us.

596
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,286
I'm sorry, Nuck.

597
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,704
This is the toughest election in our lifetimes,

598
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,164
and you're standing here telling jokes.

599
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,500
I'm sorry, Nuck. We were talking...

600
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,127
You think Fletcher's over there
at the Democratic Club

601
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,920
doing a fucking vaudeville routine?

602
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,714
Well, he's not. He's out there shaking hands,

603
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,884
trying to steal the election
out from under our goddamn noses.

604
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,886
Come on, Nuck. The Democrats?

605
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,429
The people know who they can trust.

606
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,849
The people want reform, women especially.

607
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,603
You've seen the papers, "Corruption,
violence, gunplay on the Boardwalk."

608
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,440
I'm making a change.

609
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,318
We have a plan to meet the future head-on.

610
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,487
And Ed Bader here will be a big part of that.

611
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:31,989
But he can't do it alone.

612
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,492
He'll need a strong arm
if he's going to be swinging for the fences.

613
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:38,078
A strong arm and clean record.

614
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:42,332
That's why, with great regret
and much gratitude for years of service,

615
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,126
I have this day accepted the resignation

616
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,588
of my brother Elias Thompson
for the office of Sheriff.

617
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,215
- Eli's out?
- What the hell's going on, Nuck?

618
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,341
I just told you.

619
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,759
Well, yeah, but...

620
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:56,471
Deputy Halloran, the star is yours to wear,
if you'll honor us so.

621
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,517
Well, sure I will.

622
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,896
Thanks, Nucky.

623
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,522
I won't let you down.

624
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,482
Then God bless us all.

625
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,277
And good luck on election day.

626
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,367
- Good luck, Halloran.
- How about that?

627
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,287
Mr. Harrow is on the phone.

628
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,458
Sheriff now.

629
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,127
Hey, fellas! Fellas, you wanna race?

630
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,378
I'll race you all the way to the pier.

631
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,923
- Yeah, come on.
- Come on, hurry up. Come on, let's go.

632
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:56,949
How do?

633
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,909
Who are you?

634
00:42:58,993 --> 00:42:59,993
Donald Flance.

635
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,995
I manage the property.

636
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,165
Where are the Dittrichs?

637
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,500
The photographer?

638
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,795
Snuck out yesterday, dead of night.

639
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,341
What about his wife?

640
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:15,467
Wife?

641
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:20,055
If that's who she was,
I guess she went with him.

642
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:27,062
The lease says "broom clean,"
but they couldn't be bothered.

643
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,439
Where'd they go?

644
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,774
Not sure.

645
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,613
The wife was always talking about Paris.

646
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,373
Look, Mommy. Ghosts.

647
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,895
I thought you should know,
I'm requesting a transfer.

648
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,274
What brings this on?

649
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,068
I have family near Detroit.

650
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,448
And there's a lot of liquor
coming in across the lake from Canada.

651
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,867
I heard they were looking for agents.

652
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,494
Only the best men.

653
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,496
I don't know about that.

654
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:27,956
Mmm.

655
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,794
May I speak freely, sir?

656
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,254
Please do.

657
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,966
I know you don't trust me.

658
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,428
I'm not sure why,
but I'm pretty confident that's the case.

659
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,680
What makes you think that?

660
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:51,104
The incessant questions, the dirty looks,
the insinuations about my religious beliefs.

661
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:55,859
We've been over
the Winslow shooting 50 times, sir.

662
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,486
Because something doesn't sit right.

663
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,863
But it doesn't make sense.
Why would I want him dead?

664
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,949
Temptation knows no rank, Agent Sebso.

665
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,951
What's that supposed to mean?

666
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,460
I do notice you're wearing new wing tips.

667
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,879
They were on discount.
I got them at Driscoll's.

668
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,469
This is what I mean.
I don't like what you're implying here, sir.

669
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,806
What you like is none of my concern.

670
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,849
I need men I can trust.

671
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:31,228
You can trust me, God damn it!
What do I have to do to convince you?

672
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,576
I baptize thee in the name of the Father...

673
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:47,661
- Father.
- Yes.

674
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:50,497
...the Son

675
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,959
and the Holy Ghost.

676
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,377
- Amen.
- Amen.

677
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,420
Hallelujah.

678
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,506
In the marvelous expectation
of resurrection

679
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,218
and the righteous blessings of eternal life...

680
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,803
Deacon Cuffy.

681
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:10,642
Agent Van Alden
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.

682
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,271
Have you come here
to be accepted into the arms of Christ?

683
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,356
I have never left him, Deacon.

684
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,361
Though I have at times turned from his love.

685
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,071
You cannot turn from him, sir.

686
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,283
Whatsoever the compass point,
he is there beside you.

687
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,869
I do know that to be so.

688
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,375
But this man does not.

689
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:42,716
There is a veil over his eyes, Deacon,
and a darkness in his soul.

690
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,720
Come forward.

691
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:48,972
No, thank you.

692
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,974
Young sir, come forward.

693
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,267
No, thank you.

694
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,394
Come forward, Mr. Sebso.

695
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,022
I'd really rather not.

696
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:00,442
You insult these good people
and their beliefs.

697
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:01,902
They're not my beliefs.

698
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,987
What are you afraid of, Mr. Sebso?

699
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,030
I'm not afraid. I...

700
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,865
Then let these waters wash you clean.

701
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,117
- Yes.
- He doesn't want to hear all that.

702
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,494
Be washed clean, brother.

703
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:11,578
Go on now.

704
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,830
Be washed in the blood of the lamb.

705
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:14,915
Lord Jesus.

706
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,084
Okay, fine.

707
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,336
- Amen.
- Amen.

708
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:20,921
Amen.

709
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,548
Hallelujah.

710
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,733
I just bought those.

711
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,079
Any believer may baptize, may he not?

712
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,289
That's a matter of some dispute.

713
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,625
Will you permit it here?

714
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,545
I will.

715
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,686
Do you accept Jesus as your savior?

716
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,897
Am I supposed to hold my...

717
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,818
Unburden your soul, Mr. Sebso.

718
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,155
Will you confess your sins
and accept Jesus as your savior?

719
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,824
Look, what do you expect me...

720
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:41,001
Confess your sins
and accept Jesus as your savior!

721
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,003
Accept him, accept him.

722
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,849
I ask you once again, Agent Sebso,

723
00:48:56,642 --> 00:49:00,186
will you confess your sins
and accept Jesus as your savior?

724
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:01,730
No, I don't...

725
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,449
This is not a battle, sir.

726
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:13,700
You're wrong, Deacon.

727
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,702
It is a battle against the devil himself.

728
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,539
I have seen him abroad
in the daylight and the night!

729
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,208
And by God I will force him out!

730
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:57,410
Thou hast fulfilled
the judgment of the wicked!

731
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:56,803
Last night, when I came, she sent me away.

732
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,973
Did she say why?

733
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,269
Only that she didn't need me.

734
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:10,150
She said that you knew.

735
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,027
And today?

736
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:20,326
I came at the regular time.

737
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,496
She was there.

738
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,999
They had suitcases.

739
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,921
She asked me to return some things

740
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,883
to the neighbor across the way.

741
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,220
When I came back...

742
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,849
They had disappeared.

743
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:12,796
Let's get you to bed.

744
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,172
I'm not tired.

745
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,007
You're asleep on your feet.

746
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:26,100
- Boo.
- You scared us.

747
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,520
I didn't mean to.

748
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,235
How's your father?

749
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,028
Turns out he's gonna live.

750
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:41,866
Let me get that for you.

751
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:43,576
- It's all right.
- I got it.

752
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:49,916
I know what you've been up to.

753
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,418
No, you don't.

754
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,504
Yeah, I do.

755
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,090
You've been at Abe Klein's, haven't you?

756
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,217
How do you know that?

757
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:03,263
Because you've got chocolate phosphate
right here.

758
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,350
All right, come on, buddy. Time to go to bed.

759
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,060
No arguments.

760
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,943
Did you have fun staying up late?

761
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,320
It's fun, right?

762
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,116
Few years, you and your old pop,

763
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,744
we're gonna be keeping all hours.

764
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:29,455
You'll see. It'll be just us boys.

765
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,044
All right.

766
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,796
Come on, lay down.

767
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:47,307
Mommy's gonna tuck you in.

768
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,114

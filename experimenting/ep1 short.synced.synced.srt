1
00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:11,536
(Woman moaning)

2
00:28:22,897 --> 00:28:24,016
(Sighs)

3
00:28:28,936 --> 00:28:29,816
(Cup falls)

4
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:32,776
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

5
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,936
(Giggles)

6
00:28:40,656 --> 00:28:42,897
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

7
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:44,577
I did hear something about that.

8
00:28:44,697 --> 00:28:46,777
And the queen and her twin brother.

9
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:49,817
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

10
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,737
And the other brother?

11
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,936
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

12
00:28:56,097 --> 00:28:57,736
and there's the clever one.

13
00:28:58,977 --> 00:29:00,417
Mmm...

14
00:29:00,536 --> 00:29:02,697
I hear they call him the Imp.

15
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:04,536
I hear he hates that nickname.

16
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:07,897
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

17
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:10,176
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

18
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:12,657
prone to all manner of perversions.

19
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:14,497
Clever girl.

20
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:17,937
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

21
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,736
Have you?

22
00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:22,177
- Already?
- Oh!

23
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:27,576
- The gods gave me one blessing.
- (Laughs)

24
00:29:27,696 --> 00:29:28,696
(Door opens)

25
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:34,657
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

26
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:38,296
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

27
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:40,377
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

28
00:29:40,497 --> 00:29:43,537
but our sister craves your attention.

29
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,137
She has odd cravings, our sister.

30
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:48,217
A family trait.

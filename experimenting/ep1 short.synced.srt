1
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,257
(Woman moaning)

2
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:32,257
(Sighs)

3
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:38,298
(Cup falls)

4
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:41,382
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

5
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:42,590
(Giggles)

6
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,924
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

7
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:53,674
I did hear something about that.

8
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,966
And the queen and her twin brother.

9
00:30:56,091 --> 00:30:59,133
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

10
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,133
And the other brother?

11
00:31:01,257 --> 00:31:04,465
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

12
00:31:05,674 --> 00:31:07,382
and there's the clever one.

13
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:10,174
Mmm...

14
00:31:10,298 --> 00:31:12,549
I hear they call him the Imp.

15
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:14,465
I hear he hates that nickname.

16
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,966
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

17
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:20,340
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

18
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:22,924
prone to all manner of perversions.

19
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,841
Clever girl.

20
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,424
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

21
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:31,340
Have you?

22
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:32,841
- Already?
- Oh!

23
00:31:35,757 --> 00:31:38,465
- The gods gave me one blessing.
- (Laughs)

24
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,632
(Door opens)

25
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,841
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

26
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:49,632
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

27
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:51,799
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

28
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:55,091
but our sister craves your attention.

29
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,799
She has odd cravings, our sister.

30
00:31:57,924 --> 00:31:59,966
A family trait.

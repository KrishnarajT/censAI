277
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,027
(Woman moaning)

278
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,040
(Sighs)

279
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,087
(Cup falls)

280
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:41,174
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

281
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:42,383
(Giggles)

282
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,726
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

283
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,478
I did hear something about that.

284
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:55,772
And the queen and her twin brother.

285
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,942
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

286
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,944
And the other brother?

287
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:04,280
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

288
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,200
and there's the clever one.

289
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,994
Mmm...

290
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,372
I hear they call him the Imp.

291
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:14,290
I hear he hates that nickname.

292
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:17,794
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

293
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,171
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

294
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:22,757
prone to all manner of perversions.

295
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,676
Clever girl.

296
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:28,263
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

297
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,182
Have you?

298
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,684
- Already?
- Oh!

299
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:38,314
- The gods gave me one blessing.
- (Laughs)

300
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,482
(Door opens)

301
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,697
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

302
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:49,492
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

303
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,661
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

304
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:54,956
but our sister craves your attention.

305
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,667
She has odd cravings, our sister.

306
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,836
A family trait.

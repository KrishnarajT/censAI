    "for case 1, we use can use nudenet and identify if something needs to be censored, and if whatever it is lasts for a few seconds, we delete it. we try to find similarity between frames nearing the first nude frame, and keep going back from there, and keep deleting till the moment you see that the similarity stops - so this implies the scene was cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "for case 2, we do the same things as case 1, but we then now try to summarize the cut out subtitles using some model trained on all subtitles from this show, to tell us to summarize anything relevant to the story from there and show it in a black backgroudn instead. so we gotta work on this to train a model on pure subtitles of the show. \n",
    "\n",
    "for case 3, we can just use some profanity in text detection algorithm kinda thing which can just simply remove it from there, and for the audio, since we know there is some profanity in from the subtitle, we just cut out that audio, use pydum and some python library to beep it out and replace it. not even beep we just silence it. as long as its just audio. we can even replace the subtitles with some less bad acceptable word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fore case 4, like when dany was eating that heart, we either gotta like use that ultra trained model from subs to tell us thats gonna be gore, or we just gonna have to live with it, coz i dont see how we can detect something like that. for that you need context. gpt could do it, but we dont have gpt. we shall still try with a focused trained model and see the results\n"

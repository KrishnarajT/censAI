there will be the basic screen. 
There is no point in asking if its a show or a movie, coz a movie is just a show with one episode. 

we do want to ask the user if they want moderate strict or lineant censoring

but how do you say that? you can put it in brackets, or directly ask. 


so 

Enter the path of your media folder (TV Show / Movie) that contains n videos with n subttile files of the same name. 

/path/to/media/folder

Enter censorship strength: 
1. Moderate - Only Explicit on screen exposed nudity is removed. 
2. Strict - Almost all on screen nudity is removed. If any story is present in said scenes, an AI generated summary is provided on a black screen later. Profane dialogues are muted and their subttiles replaced by AI generated sentences with the same meaning. 

You will have `<video_name>_censored_<moderate/strict>.<ext>` in your media folder along with subtitles of the same name. 

Detected 10 videos and 10 subtitles.
Do you want to continue? (y/n)
